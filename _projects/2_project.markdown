**Technologies learned: ** Sparse transformer (Natural Language Processing)
**Tools/Programming languages used: ** Python, C 

In the Summer of 2019, I was fortunate to intern at Microsoft as a firmware development for Project Brainwave. My goal was to research the sparse transformer NLP model, simulate it and evaluate its performance for inference for Bing.

## Project Brainwave 

Project Brainwave is a FPGA based deep learning platform, which accelerates deep neural network (DNN) inferencing for application in natural language processing and computer vision.
