## The Setting

On March 11, 2020, the WHO not only declared COVID-19 a pandemic but also expressed serious concern regarding inaction on the part of many countries around the globe to stem the spread of the pandemic. By the end of May, 42 states and territories had followed suit, impacting 73% of U.S. counties in doing so (Center for Disease Control, 2020). Remote instruction became the norm for many colleges and universities in the U.S. during the pandemic despite the fact that less than 5% of budgets associated with colleges and universities is dedicated to IT support (Gallagher & Palmer, 2020).  Under normal circumstances, remote instruction can be beneficial as it provides students and instructors with the flexibility to teach and learn from anywhere. However, the abrupt nature of the transition during the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be compared to traditional models of online learning. These models involve prior planning and preparation to deliver course content tailored to the online setting. The development time for a fully online university course can range between six to nine months prior to its delivery. Moreover, it can take two or three iterations of an online course for faculty to feel comfortable with teaching it. During the COVID-19 pandemic, instructors did not have the time to carefully design and transition face-to-face courses to an online environment. Remote learning during the pandemic was a temporary response to a quickly evolving crisis. Due of the abrupt transition from traditional classroom teaching to teaching remotely, the assumption was frequently made that the quality of education would drop. However, we have found these assumptions to be true in some but not all cases. Nevertheless, the transition to emergency remote teaching has resulted in a shift in student expectations of how, when, and how much faculty and TAs will be available to them for help as well as how many and what types of resources will be made available to students to support their learning. Students have also adjusted how and how much they interact with their peers and some of the tools they have acquired and acclimated to are likely to remain in their toolbox as they head back into in-person learning in the traditional classroom. 

We conducted surveys of a wide range of engineering courses at the University of Washington's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, to understand what happened to instructional support during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey included both Likert-scale items to measure faculty, TA, and peer support as well as short answer questions.
