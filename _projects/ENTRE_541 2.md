As part of the Technology Entrepreneurship Certificate, I took a class on technology commercialization in Spring 2021. The goal of the class was to learn various tools and methodologies to effectively evaluate an emerging University of Washington (UW) research technology and craft a commercialization plan for it. Throughout the quarter, I worked in a team with four MBA student to analyze a UW technology, conduct a market and opportunity analysis, interview potential customers and draft a recommendation for potential ways to commercialize the technology.

     The MUST Sensor
</div>

My team worked on a Mobility Unit for Sensing (MUST) integrated sensor technology developed by researchers at Smart Transportation Applications and Research lab (STAR Lab) at the University of Washingtonâ€™s department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. The technology was designed to be applied in smart cities applications, specifically for monitoring traffic and addressing congestion problems that cities face. MUST is a sensing and communication technology that can be used for a range of applications such as parking lot management, vehicle counting, roadway monitoring etc. The device consists of a variety of integrated sensors and bundles multiple functions into one unit: road surface, weather data, traffic sensing, data fusion and computation and communication.
