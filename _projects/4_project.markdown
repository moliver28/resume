## The Setting

A 2015 survey of 256 institutions from the US revealed that 70% of their capstone programs were funded by industry and government sponsors. This indicates the pervasiveness of capstone programs that partner with external sponsors to provide a “real-world” design experience to students. In this vein, the industry-sponsored Engineering Innovation and Entrepreneurship (ENGINE) capstone program was established at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at a large research university in the US. ENGINE is designed to provide a holistic and professional engineering experience to students in an educational setting, where student teams work on a six-month long project under the guidance of an industry and a faculty mentor. The program is overseen by a course instructor and teaching assistants who manage the course structure and expectations.

## The Study 

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 virus a global pandemic [1], which necessitated preventative measures such as social distancing and forced many higher education institutions to close campuses, abandon traditional practices of in-person classes and rapidly switch to remote learning environments. Consequently, students had to adapt to their new and unprecedented learning environments in very limited time. 
This study focuses on the ENGINE capstone ato understand how students perceived, adapted to, and mitigated the impact of the pandemic. The study compared student experiences in ENGINE during remote learning necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic to those in traditional, in-person learning. ENGINE students were surveyed in Spring 2018 and Spring 2020 to understand which components of the ENGINE program mattered most to student learning and how. The work complements existing studies by taking a quantitative and qualitative look at how and when capstone design students adapted to the abrupt transition from traditional to remote learning.

## Methods 

* Close-ended Likert scale based survey responses were analyzed using statistical methods such as Exploratory Factor Analysis and independent sample t-tests. 
* Short answer questions were analyzed using qualitative methods in a sequential, mixed methods approach.

## Results

Exploratory factor analysis of the Likert-scale items revealed that measures of instructional support and “real-world” experience contributed to student learning. No statistically significant differences in these measures between remote and traditional learning environments emerged. To address this lack of difference, a qualitative analysis was conducted to understand how the student capstone design experience changed during the pandemic. The qualitative analysis revealed that the lack of significant difference may be due to the fact **that students rapidly adapted to the remote learning disruption.** 

The results provide an insight into the various ways in which students acclimated to the crisis circumstances. These adaptations manifested in the form of product and process adaptations, in which students swiftly adjusted their final product or design process to respond to the evolving crisis. Students used various strategies such as changing team roles and ways of communication, using different tools and technology, and creative technical solutions to drive product and process adaptations. However, these adaptations may have come at the cost of students' mental health. By shedding light on student experience of the capstone during the pandemic, this study acknowledges the resilience students have displayed during a crisis, while recognizing that the cost of such resilience must not be neglected.
