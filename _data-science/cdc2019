In this study, we wanted to optimize the detection of advanced persistent threats (APTs), which are stealthy and hard to detect cyber attacks. To do so, modeled the interaction between APTs and Dynamic Information Flow Tracking (DIFT) defense mechanism as a dynamic game (from game theory). The game involves selecting processes in the system to perform security analysis, which affects the efficiency and resource usage of detection. To solve the game, we proposed a supervised learning-based approach to learn an approximate Nash equilibrium (NE) and demonstrated its convergence using real-world data.

# Goal
Implementation and operation of DIFT, however, introduce memory and performance overhead on the system as it involves tracking and analyzing a large number of benign flows. Thus an optimal selection of processes in the system to perform security analysis is critical for effective and resource efficient detection. Therefore, the goal for this project was to model a cost-effective DIFT-based defense mechanism against APTs that:
- Captures the trade-off between detection accuracy and resource efficiency.
- Accounts for rate of false negatives.
