# Goal
The goal of this project was to visualize the various metrics that characterize regional innovation systems in the U.S. These metrics belong to three main categories: university research and development (R&D), industry structure, and entrepreneurship. These metrics vary across regions and are dependent on the universities, industries, policies, and other characteristics of a regional environment.

# Method

We chose the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) as the regional unit of analysis. Even though conducting a state-level analysis would be easier, as a lot of federal data is easily accessible at the state level, it would be based on the false assumption that university-industry collaborations occur uniformly across a state. In reality, these collaborations (for all three dimensions: industry, research and entrepreneurship) are centered in urban, metropolitan regions. Therefore, an analysis at the MSA level will provide a more detailed and specific picture of these interactions.
Furthermore, as a starting point, we decided to choose 2019 as the year for analysis. This is because data for 2020 and 2021 will likely be influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. To control scope, we only looked at cross-sectional data.
