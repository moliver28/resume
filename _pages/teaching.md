## Industry Sponsored Engineering Design Capstone (ENGINE)

In 2015, I participated in the electrical and computer engineering departmentâ€™s pilot for a capstone course, in which students work on industry projects for two quarters. The experience had a significant impact on me, and I returned to the program as a lead teaching assistant (TA) in 2018. Since then, I have achieved the following:

- Led 5 cohorts of the program, during which the number of students grew from over 85+ (20+ projects) to 250+ students (52 projects).
- Managed a team of TAs that grew from 2 to 4 members in five years.
- Designed and implemented the program curriculum, which included assignments, meeting and presentation schedules, community events, etc.
- Mentored more than 150 students (50+ teams) by assisting with design project scoping, providing technical support, managing interpersonal conflicts, and overseeing project management.

As a result of my work, I was a finalist for the Outstanding Teaching Award in 2022 across all UW departments, and in 2019, I won the Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award, which was presented by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
