## <a href= "https://www.ece.uw.edu/entrepreneurship/entrepreneurial-capstone/">Industry Sponsored Engineering Design Capstone</a>

Since 2018, have been the lead TA for my department's senior design capstone in which students work on industry projects for two quarters, during which I have achieved the following:

- Led the growth and success of 5 cohorts of the program, during which the number of students grew from over 85+ (20+ projects) to 250+ students (52 projects).

- Managed a growing team of TAs that grew from 2 to 4 members in five years.

- Designed and implemented an innovative curriculum for the program, including assignments, meeting and presentation schedules, and community events, resulting in higher student engagement.

- Mentored over 150 students (50+ teams) by providing guidance and support for design project scoping, technical assistance, interpersonal conflict resolution, and project management, resulting in successful project completion and student satisfaction.

As a result of my work, I was a finalist for the Outstanding Teaching Award in 2022 across all UW departments, and in 2019, I won the Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award, which was presented by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

The program is a part of Riverways Education Partnerships (formerly known as The Pipeline Project) and serves rural and tribal schools across Washington State.  I first participated in the Environmental ASB (EASB) in 2013 during which I:
- Developed and delivered an engaging curriculum to elementary and middle school students at the Quileute Tribal School in La Push, educating them about Washington's diverse environment.
- Facilitated meaningful learning experiences for students by implementing interactive activities, resulting in high student engagement and positive feedback.
- Contributed to the success of the program by collaborating effectively with team members, and demonstrating strong leadership skills, resulting in an impactful program.

I returned to the program in 2017 to pilot an engineering focused ASB program during which I : 
- Founded and directed the Engineering Alternative Spring Break program for high school students in Yakima Valley, Washington, providing a unique opportunity for students to engage with engineering concepts.
- Recruited and trained a team of 5 students to design and implement a weeklong engineering-focused curriculum at Granger High School, resulting in high levels of student engagement and positive feedback from both students and teachers.
- Led a seminar series for 20+ university students, providing guidance and support in developing culturally responsive STEM curricula that met the needs and interests of multicultual student populations.
- Contributed to the development of inclusive and equitable STEM education practices by incorporating culturally responsive teaching techniques and promoting inclusion and equity in the Engineering Alternative Spring Break program.

## Other Engineering Courses
During my Masters I have TA'ed for all of the courses in the embedded systems series including Introduction to Microcontrollers (EE 299), Digital Circuits (EE 271), Digital Design (EE 371), Introduction to Embedded Systems (EE474) and Embedded Systems Capstone (EE475). In all of these classes, I facilitated lab sessions, graded assignments and exams and provided technical assistance to students for their lab work.
