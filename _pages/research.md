### An Educational Perspective: Assessing the Value of Industry Supported Engineering Capstone Programs

<img align="right" width="300" height="200" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/engr_design_process.jpg">

Mixed methods research to develop measures and survey instruments that will help in assessing how industry-sponsored engineering design capstones add value to students' educational experience. This research studies how students' perceptions of various factors such as instructional support, industry mentor support, team support, their creativity etc. impacted their perceptions of what they learned about engineering design. The research is focused on a industry-sponsored capstone program. As part of this study, I conducted interviews with capstone students and analyzed qualitative and quantitative (survey) capstone data from multiple years.

### A Digital Tools Perspective: Uncovering Stakeholder Motivations, Information Needs and Practices in an Innovation Ecosystem

Developing a data-driven visualization tool to comprehensively understand stakeholders' motivations, information needs and practices in an innovation ecosystem. The goal of this study is to articulate how multiple stakeholders interact in an innovation ecosystem to solve comples socio-technical problems and identify relevant measures of innovation activity around research and entrepreneurship. For this work, I am creating multiple data visualization prototypes (an example is found <a href="https://shruti-misra.github.io/innovation-dashboard/">here</a>). I will then conduct exploratory and evaluative user research to group stakeholders based on their information needs and usage.
