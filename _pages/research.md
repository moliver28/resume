<img align="left" src="pathto/engr_design_process.jpg" alt="My Image">

Mixed methods research to develop measures and survey instruments that will help in assessing how industry-sponsored engineering design capstones add value to students' educational experience. This research studies how students' perceptions of various factors such as instructional support, industry mentor support, team support, their creativity etc. impacted their perceptions of what they learned about engineering design. The research is focused on a industry-sponsored capstone program. As part of this study, I conducted interviews with capstone students and analyzed qualitative and quantitative (survey) capstone data from multiple years.
