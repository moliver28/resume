My title of a PhD candidate/researcher underlies my core identify of an explorer. Through delving into multiple disiciplines and growing up in different cities and I have become skilled at learning about, investigating and building for novel, ambiguous and unfamiliar problem spaces and people situations. I started out as an electrical engineer interested in <a href = "https://www.washington.edu/boundless/powering-promise/">sustainability</a> and found my way to becoming a mixed-methods researcher motivated by the need to drive impact. As a researcher, I like to leverage the combined power of data/numbers and qualitative insights (interviews, document analyses etc.) to tell compelling stories and answer research questions.
