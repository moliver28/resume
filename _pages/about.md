Trained as an data scientist and computer engineer, I have an extensive background working with varied datasets and using advanced statistical and machine learning methods. I also enjoy storytelling by building interactive data visualizations (often in Python or Tableau) and communicating data-driven stories across diverse audiences. 


I am currently expanding my skill set to topics such as time series analysis and machine learning methods for analyzing trends in energy systems and I am excited to continue learning new ways of deriving actionable insight from data in a fast-paced and collaborative environment.
