Iâ€™m a researcher and a data scientist focused on solving problems at the intersection of technology and business.

Currently I:

- Research how public-private partnerships help commercialize clean energy technologies starting from the lab to the demonstration stage

Previously I:

- Was a venture analyst for <a href = "https://www.packvc.com/">Pack Ventures</a>
- Lead the senior engineering design capstone program at the University of Washington, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
- Worked on commercializing a childhood asthma management app as part of the <a href = "https://www.iths.org/education/graduate/commercialization-fellowship/">  WRF/ITHS Summer Commercilization program</a>
- Helped with startups in the  <a href = "https://creativedestructionlab.com/locations/seattle/">Creative Destruction Labs accelerator</a> with go-to-market.
- Designed a dashboard in Tableau to visualize innovation activity in 30 U.S cities.
- Developed a <a href = "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9029404">novel supervised machine learning model</a> to find optimal defense strategies against Advanced Persistant (cyber) Threats. 
- Implemented and evaluated a sparse <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> models to make Bing inferencing faster as a machine learning firmware intern at Microsoft.
- Used data from a GPS sensor and magnetometer to locate an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in association with Booz Allen Hamilton
- Built IoT applications to collect data and monitor the status of a portable hybrid solar inverter for a startup (Athena Energy Corp: now defunct).

When I'm not obsessing over research, you can find me taking long city walks in search of bakeries and coffee, baking, trying to get good at music/drums or above all reading a book!
