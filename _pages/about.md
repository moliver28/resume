 I am researcher, specializing in studying innovation in grid-scale long-duration energy storage, I bring knowledge in electricity markets and analyzing technologies for a cleaner grid. My expertise lies in planning and executing quantitative and qualitative research, data analysis, Python, SQL, inferential statistics, data visualization (Tableau, Altair), machine learning and communicating research findings across diverse audiences. With a proven track record in market and product research across industries, and 6 years of education program management experience, I excel at aligning research goals with business objective and deriving actionable insights from data to drive impact.

Currently I:

- Research how <a href = "https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2021/an-evolving-dictionary-for-an-evolving-grid-defining-long-duration-energy-storage.html#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20single%20definition,firm%20capacity%20to%20the%20grid.">long duration energy storage technologies</a> scale from lab to market.

Recently I:

- Was a venture analyst for <a href = "https://www.packvc.com/">Pack Ventures</a>.
- Led the <a href = "https://www.ece.uw.edu/entrepreneurship/entrepreneurial-capstone/">engineering design capstone program</a> at the University of Washington, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
- Worked on commercializing a childhood asthma management through the <a href = "https://www.iths.org/education/graduate/commercialization-fellowship/">  WRF/ITHS Summer Commercilization program</a>.
- Helped startups in the  <a href = "https://creativedestructionlab.com/locations/seattle/">Creative Destruction Labs accelerator</a> with go-to-market.

A little while ago I: 
- Used GPS sensor and magnetometer data to locate an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) <a href = "https://www.ece.uw.edu/spotlight/entrepreneurial-students-present-project-at-booz-allen-hamilton-idea-fest/">, mentored by Booz Allen Hamilton</a>.
- Built IoT applications for a portable hybrid solar inverter for a startup (Athena Energy Corp: now defunct).
- Led <a href = "https://www.washington.edu/boundless/powering-promise/">a project</a> at UW Solar to assess the feasibility of installing solar panels on Agua Verde Cafe and Paddle Club. 

When I'm not obsessing over research, you can find me taking long city walks in search of bakeries, baking, trying to get good at <a href = "https://shruti-misra.github.io/ps/">music/drums or above all reading a book!</a>.
