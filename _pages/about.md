I am a Data Science PhD student at University of Washington, with experience in research, industry, and venture capital. I am looking for full time positions for Fall 2023. Iâ€™m interested in technical positions that involve using data-driven methods to complex solve problems.  My expertise lies in integrating computational/statistical analysis and visualization of heterogenous data with interviews and surveys to identify, define and refine actionable insights that help drive impact.

In addition to research, I also have experience performing due diligence on investment opportunities under consideration by <a href = "https://www.packvc.com">Pack Ventures</a>. This includes evaluating market potential, scientific novelty and competitive landscape of STEM innovations.

My prior technical background includes embedded systems engineering, control theory and machine learning
