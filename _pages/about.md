As a PhD candidate and researcher, I'm an explorer at heart. My diverse upbringing in various cities and interdisciplinary approach to learning, have equipped me with the ability to investigate and design solutions for complex, ambiguous and unfamiliar problems and situations. 

Initially drawn to electrical engineering by my interest in  <a href = "https://www.washington.edu/boundless/powering-promise/">sustainability</a>, my passion for real-world impact has evolved into a mixed-methods research approach. I enjoy blending quantitative (external datasets, surveys, etc.) and qualitative data sources (interviews, document analyses etc.), to craft engaging stories and address research questions.

When I'm not obsessing over research, you can find me taking long city walks in search of bakeries and coffee, baking, trying to get good at music/drums or most importantly reading a book!
