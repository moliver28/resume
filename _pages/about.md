Iâ€™m a <a href = "https://shruti-misra.github.io/data-science/">data scientist</a> and a researcher focused on solving problems at the intersection of technology and business.

Currently I:

- Research how public-private partnerships help commercialize <a href = "https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2021/an-evolving-dictionary-for-an-evolving-grid-defining-long-duration-energy-storage.html#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20single%20definition,firm%20capacity%20to%20the%20grid.">long duration energy storage technologies</a> starting from the lab to the demonstration stage.

Recently I:

- Was a venture analyst for <a href = "https://www.packvc.com/">Pack Ventures</a>.
- Led the <a href = "https://www.ece.uw.edu/entrepreneurship/entrepreneurial-capstone/">senior engineering design capstone program</a> at the University of Washington, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
- Worked on commercializing a childhood asthma management app as part of the <a href = "https://www.iths.org/education/graduate/commercialization-fellowship/">  WRF/ITHS Summer Commercilization program</a>.
- Helped startups in the  <a href = "https://creativedestructionlab.com/locations/seattle/">Creative Destruction Labs accelerator</a> with go-to-market.

A little while ago I: 
- Used data from a GPS sensor and magnetometer to locate an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) <a href = "https://www.ece.uw.edu/spotlight/entrepreneurial-students-present-project-at-booz-allen-hamilton-idea-fest/">in association with Booz Allen Hamilton</a>.
- Built IoT applications to collect data and monitor the status of a portable hybrid solar inverter for a startup (Athena Energy Corp: now defunct).
- Lea <a href = "https://www.washington.edu/boundless/powering-promise/">a project</a> at UW Solar to assess the feasibility of installing solar panels on Agua Verde Cafe and Paddle Club. 

When I'm not obsessing over research, you can find me taking long city walks in search of bakeries and coffee, baking, trying to get good at <a href = "https://shruti-misra.github.io/ps/">music/drums or above all reading a book!</a>.
