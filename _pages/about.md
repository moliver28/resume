As a PhD candidate and researcher, I consider myself an explorer at heart. My diverse upbringing in various cities, coupled with my interdisciplinary approach to learning, has equipped me with the ability to investigate and design solutions for complex, ambiguous and unfamiliar problems and situations. 

While my initial interest in <a href = "https://www.washington.edu/boundless/powering-promise/">sustainability</a> led me to pursue electrical engineering, my passion for driving real-world impact has since evolved into a mixed-methods research approach. I enjoy blending quantitative (external datasets, surveys, etc.) and qualitative data sources (interviews, document analyses etc.), to craft engaging stories and address research questions.

When I'm not obsessing over research, you can find me taking long city walks in search of bakeries and coffee, baking, trying to get good at music/drums or most importantly reading a book!
