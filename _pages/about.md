I care about elevating people's lives through projects that promote <a href = "https://shruti-misra.github.io/research/">well-being and education </a>, and make this planet more sustainable. A common thread in all these pursuits is my deep appreciation for the power of <a href = "https://shruti-misra.github.io/data-science/"> data </a>, which I use to inform decisions and drive positive change. 
From research in health, education, and energy along with pursuing artistic endeavors, my goal is to leave a lasting impact on society.

Currently I:

- Research how <a href = "https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2021/an-evolving-dictionary-for-an-evolving-grid-defining-long-duration-energy-storage.html#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20single%20definition,firm%20capacity%20to%20the%20grid.">long duration energy storage technologies</a> scale from lab to market.

Recently I:

- Was a venture analyst for <a href = "https://www.packvc.com/">Pack Ventures</a>.
- Led the <a href = "https://www.ece.uw.edu/entrepreneurship/entrepreneurial-capstone/">engineering design capstone program</a> at the University of Washington, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
- Worked on commercializing a childhood asthma management through the <a href = "https://www.iths.org/education/graduate/commercialization-fellowship/">  WRF/ITHS Summer Commercilization program</a>.
- Helped startups in the  <a href = "https://creativedestructionlab.com/locations/seattle/">Creative Destruction Labs accelerator</a> with go-to-market.

A little while ago I: 
- Used GPS sensor and magnetometer data to locate an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) <a href = "https://www.ece.uw.edu/spotlight/entrepreneurial-students-present-project-at-booz-allen-hamilton-idea-fest/">, mentored by Booz Allen Hamilton</a>.
- Built IoT applications for a portable hybrid solar inverter for a startup (Athena Energy Corp: now defunct).
- Led <a href = "https://www.washington.edu/boundless/powering-promise/">a project</a> at UW Solar to assess the feasibility of installing solar panels on Agua Verde Cafe and Paddle Club. 

When I'm not obsessing over research, you can find me taking long city walks in search of bakeries, baking, trying to get good at <a href = "https://shruti-misra.github.io/ps/">music/drums or above all reading a book!</a>.
