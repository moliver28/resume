Iâ€™m a researcher and data scientist focused on solving problems at the intersection of technology and business.

I currently:

- Research how public-private partnerships help commercialize clean energy technologies starting from the lab to the demonstration stage
- Lead the senior engineering design capstone program at the University of Washington, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
- Am a venture fellow for <a href = "https://www.packvc.com/">Pack Ventures</a>

Previously, I:

- Was a technology commercialization fellow for the <a href = "https://www.google.com/search?q=WRF%2FITHS+program&rlz=1C1MSIM_enUS743US747&oq=WRF%2FITHS+program&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.4520j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">  WRF/ITHS Summer Commercilization program</a>, where I worked on commercializing a childhood asthma management app. 
- Worked with startups in the  <a href = "https://creativedestructionlab.com/locations/seattle/">Creative Destruction Labs accelerator</a>, where I primarily worked with <a href = "https://www.valoranthealth.com/">Valorant Health</a> to help identify metrics they should collect to prove business value, states where they can expand and partnerships with public healthcare programs like Medicare/Medicaid.
- Designed a dashboard in Tableau using data from the NSF, Pitchbook and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to visualize innovation activites (research, education and entrepreneurship) in 30 U.S cities and asked different stakeholders about whether these indicators are actually useful to their decision-making.
- Developed a <a href = "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9029404">novel supervised machine learning model</a> to find optimal defense strategies against Advanced Persistant (cyber) Threats. 
- Implemented and evaluated a sparse approach to make Bing inferencing faster as a machine learning firmware intern at Microsoft.
- Used data from a GPS sensor and magnetometer to locate an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in association with Booz Allen Hamilton
- Built a suite of IoT applications to collected data and monitor the status of a portable hybrid solar inverter for a startup (Athena Energy Corp: now closed).

When I'm not obsessing over research, you can find me taking long city walks in search of bakeries and coffee, baking, trying to get good at music/drums or above all reading a book!
