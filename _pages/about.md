With a background in data science and computer engineering, I bring extensive experience in handling diverse datasets and using advanced statistical and machine learning methods. I also enjoy storytelling by designing interactive data visualizations (often in Python or Tableau), to effectively communicate data-driven narratives to diverse audiences.

Presently, I am broadening my skill set to encompass areas such as time series analysis and machine learning methods tailored for examining trends in energy systems. I am eager to continue my learning new ways to extract actionable insights from data within fast-paced and collaborative environments.
