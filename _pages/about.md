I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus on Data Science at the University of Washington (UW). I am a <a href = "https://catalyst.harvard.edu/community-engagement/mmr/">mixed-methods</a> researcher whose research focuses on one key question: 

How do people, organizations and regions innovate? 

<b>I am currently looking for industry positions.</b>

My research focuses on exploring how universities collaborate with industry to further education and entrepreneurship. I primarily use mixed-methods research approaches, which means I integrate quantitative statistical analysis with exploratory research methods such as interviewing, surveys and document analysis to answer research question.

In addition to research, I also have experience performing due diligence on investment opportunities under consideration by <a href = "https://www.packvc.com">Pack Ventures</a>. This includes evaluating market potential, scientific novelty and competitive landscape of STEM innovations.

My prior technical background includes embedded systems engineering, control theory and machine learning.
