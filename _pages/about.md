<em>"Always go a little further into the water than you feel you’re capable of being in. Go a little bit out of your depth. And when you feel that your feet aren’t quite touching the bottom, you’re just about in the right place to do something exciting” -David Bowie</em>

Following the words of one of my favourite artists David Bowie, I find inspirtation in pursuing exciting opportunities thatallow me to leave a positive impact on people's lives. I care about elevating people's lives through projects that promote people's <a href = "https://shruti-misra.github.io/research/">well-being and education</a>, make this planet more sustainable and bring bring joy through artistic expression. A common thread in all these pursuits is my deep appreciation for the power of <a href = "https://shruti-misra.github.io/data-science/"> data </a>, which I use to inform decisions and drive positive change. From research in health and education to sustainable living initiatives and artistic endeavors, my goal is to leave a lasting impact on society, echoing Bowie's call to embrace exciting opportunities that make a difference. 

Currently I:

- Research how <a href = "https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2021/an-evolving-dictionary-for-an-evolving-grid-defining-long-duration-energy-storage.html#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20single%20definition,firm%20capacity%20to%20the%20grid.">long duration energy storage technologies</a> scale from lab to market.

Recently I:

- Was a venture analyst for <a href = "https://www.packvc.com/">Pack Ventures</a>.
- Led the <a href = "https://www.ece.uw.edu/entrepreneurship/entrepreneurial-capstone/">engineering design capstone program</a> at the University of Washington, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
- Worked on commercializing a childhood asthma management through the <a href = "https://www.iths.org/education/graduate/commercialization-fellowship/">  WRF/ITHS Summer Commercilization program</a>.
- Helped startups in the  <a href = "https://creativedestructionlab.com/locations/seattle/">Creative Destruction Labs accelerator</a> with go-to-market.

A little while ago I: 
- Used GPS sensor and magnetometer data to locate an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) <a href = "https://www.ece.uw.edu/spotlight/entrepreneurial-students-present-project-at-booz-allen-hamilton-idea-fest/">, mentored by Booz Allen Hamilton</a>.
- Built IoT applications for a portable hybrid solar inverter for a startup (Athena Energy Corp: now defunct).
- Led <a href = "https://www.washington.edu/boundless/powering-promise/">a project</a> at UW Solar to assess the feasibility of installing solar panels on Agua Verde Cafe and Paddle Club. 

When I'm not obsessing over research, you can find me taking long city walks in search of bakeries, baking, trying to get good at <a href = "https://shruti-misra.github.io/ps/">music/drums or above all reading a book!</a>.
