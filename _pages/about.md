Hi ! I’m a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus on Data Science at the University of Washington (UW), advised by <a href="https://people.ece.uw.edu/wilson/">Prof. Denise Wilson</a>. I am an interdisciplinary <a href = "https://catalyst.harvard.edu/community-engagement/mmr/">mixed-methods</a> researcher bridging the disciplines of engineering design, innovation studies and business by using methodologies from data science and human-centered design. 

My dissertation broadly focuses on exploring how various public and private stakeholders collaborate to create flourishing and equitable innovation ecosystems. One aspect of my research explores this collaboration in the context of industry-supported engineering design education. Another aspect of my work explores how exiting digital tools and metrics support stakeholder interactions, information needs and practices in an innovation ecosystem.

In the vein of "learning by doing", I have complemented my research experience by being actively involved in the University of Washington innovation ecosystem. I am currently pursuing the <a href="https://foster.uw.edu/centers/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship/entrepreneurship-certificate/)">Technology Entrepreneurship Certificate </a> at UW's Buerk Center for Entrepreneurship. My team was a finalist in the 2022 <a href = "https://foster.uw.edu/centers/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship/entrepreneurship-competitions/uw-health-innovation-challenge/">Hollomon Health Innovation Challenge</a>. Additionally, I was the  <a href = "https://blog.foster.uw.edu/2022-commercialization-fellowship/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=2022-commercialization-fellowship"> ITHS/WRF 2022 Summer Commercialization Fellow</a>
