In my previous post I talked about the various definitions of innovation and introduced the notion of a system of innovation consisting of organizations, institutions, and networks. One of the main takeaways was that innovation is not a solo endeavor (the myth of the lone inventor). It is facilitated by a system of interacting organizations steeped in various institutions and networks, which determines the outcome of the innovation process. 
In this post, I attempt to make this idea concrete through a couple of real-world stories.

# The Story of Route 128 and Silicon Valley (in the 1980s-1990s)

This story is adapted from AnnaLee Saxenian's popular comparison of the Silicon Valley and Route 128 [1].

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3dbu6A2jTgD2QPvat7NofQ.png" height= "400" width = "600"></p>

Silicon Valley is a major hub of technological innovation. It is known to be the home of innovative technology giants such as Facebook, Apple, Google and many more. However, in the 1980s the picture was different. Silicon Valley was not the only technology hub in the country, it was competing with Route 128, located near Boston. Between 1959 and 1970, Route 128 had a higher total high-technology employment than Silicon Valley, indicating its dominance in the electronics industry. However, after 1975, the trend changed and Silicon Valley surpassed Route 128 in the total high-technology employment. Furthermore, between 1985 and 1990, the number of fastest growing electronics companies was declining in Route 128 and increasing in Silicon Valley. These trends provoke the question- what was going on? Here are two systems of innovation (SIs), one growing fast while the other declining. 
What might be driving this pattern? To answer this question, I look at what some of the organizations in both regions were doing.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*zvTcLt3pN5opsAnpN7_CpA.png"></p>

## 1.1 The Giants: HP and DEC

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IUQLgqdEsxoUwAdUlLeb2A.png"></p>

Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)and HP were both major organizations in the electronics industry in the 1980s. Both were established early on in the history of electronics. DEC was established in Maynard, Massachusetts (Route 128) in 1957 and HP was founded in Palo Alto, California (Silicon Valley) in 1939. Moreover, DEC dominated Route 128 unlike any other company (including HP) dominated Silicon Valley. However, HP is still around, while DEC got acquired by Compaq at the end of the 1990s, which ironically got acquired by HP in 2002. What did HP and DEC do differently? We can analyze these difference through the lens of innovation systems and examine the <b><i>institutions and networks</i></b> driving both of these organizations.

### 1.1.1 HP & DEC: Institutions

There were notable institutional differences in how HP and DEC functioned.

* <b>Proprietary vs. Open systems:</b> DEC was adamant about building proprietary systems. They believed that the value of their products was in the "secret sauce" of their hardware and software systems. Whereas HP encouraged emerging open systems such as the UNIX operating system, which made their products compatible with other products in the market. Furthermore, HP was an early investor in the Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessor architecture, which was faster. Consequently, by1990, HP controlled 31% of the $8 billion RISC computer market, in which DEC still had no presence. DEC was still very focused on furthering the vision for its proprietary VMX operating system and VAX architecture, despite the industry shifting to UNIX and RISC based technology. In 1992, when DEC finally introduced its own RISC processor, it was too late and they ended up controlling only 13% of the market.
* <b>Organizational Structure: </b> HP was a large, decentralized firm and had an autonomous divisional structure that trained general managers while also giving them the power to make decisions fast. The benefit of this structure is described by a 16-year veteran of DEC who later switched to HP:

<blockquote>
"Running a business at the division level, you get a chance to be a general manager. You get a chance to learn . . . to be creative. . . . There are a lot of new divisions springing up [within HP], new ideas springing up, brand new businesses, and old divisions that couldn't make it anymore transform themselves into new businesses" - (From Saxenian 1996)
</blockquote>

Thus, HP was fostering entrepreneurial opportunities and innovation within it. In contrast, DEC's highly centralized matrix structure disincentivized such efforts by concentrating decision making power in a few top executives. Moreover, HP's decentralized structure provided it with the agility required to survive in the highly competitive market of the time, while DEC's centralized structure prevented it from making quick decisions and moving fast.

### *TLDR

<p style="padding: 10px; background-color: LightGoldenrodYellow;">
HP's open and decentralized institutions allowed it to quickly capitalize on emerging trends in technology. It's readiness to acknowledge and adopt changing trends was driven by an organizational structure that supported experimentation and autonomy at lower levels of the organization. These institutional characteristics allowed HP to remain ahead of the curve and adapt to changing times.
On the other hand, DEC's proprietary and centralized institutional practices prevented it from making the quick changes it needed to remain competitive. Its reluctance to recognize and adapt to technological shifts was furthered by a centralized organizational structure. This meant that the power to govern DEC's direction was concentrated in a few number of top executives, who refused to acknowledge new technological trends and caused DEC to lose its edge by the 1990s.

### 1.1.2 HP & DEC: Networks

In early 1980s, both HP and DEC had a high level of vertical integration. However, later in the decade HP recognized that it could not produce everything in-house and decided to build external alliances . It started outsourcing some of the fabrication to external partners and worked with local companies offering complimentary technologies. Being part of a vibrant external network provided HP with access to a wealth of information about new technologies. This allowed them to identify and capitalize upon emerging trends such as open-source systems and RISC.
Meanwhile, DEC decided to stick with vertical integration. Route 128's autarkic culture meant that the region offered little social and technical support for DEC to pivot to a more flexible and connected organizational model. Since most organizations in the region preferred to be vertically integrated and operated in isolation, the region did not lend itself to supporting a thriving network of smaller companies and open exchange of information. Tom Furlong, an engineer working for DEC at the time articulates this as follows.

<blockquote>
"The same job of bringing a new workstation to market takes two times as long in the East coast and many more people than it does here. In Maynard (DEC), I had to do everything inside the company. I can rely on the other companies in Silicon Valley. It's easier and cheaper for me to rely on the little companies in Silicon Valley to take care of the things I need, and it forces them to compete and be more efficient." - (From Saxenian 1996)
</blockquote>

By creating a market for local companies to compete in, HP was encouraging them to innovate. These innovations would then find their way back to HP, giving them a competitive edge. However, DEC did not have the same access to information as it was not connected to an external network in the same way as HP. Therefore, it was unable to identify technology trends in time, and when it did, its centralized institutions did not allow it to move fast enough, causing DEC to be left behind.

<i>My favorite vignette from this story is that DEC's Palo Alto lab had developed state-of-the-art RISC and UNIX technologies in the early 1980s. However, its discoveries were ignored by the HQ in Route 128, which favored its existing profitable VAX-VMS system. Industry insiders believe that DEC's Palo Alto lab contributed more to Silicon Valley firms than it did to DEC, as their findings were quickly disseminated through the Valley's burgeoning networks.</i>

### *TLDR

<p style="padding: 10px; background-color: LightGoldenrodYellow;">
HP intentionally built external alliances and plugged into Silicon Valley's network of local firms, academics and smaller companies. Through this network, they were able to quickly obtain "the word on the street" about upcoming technological trends and capitalize it to maintain their competitive edge. By partnering with external contractors and smaller companies, they also created a competitive market for these companies to innovation.
  
DEC was internally focused and vertically integrated. This was partly because the isolated culture of Route 128 meant that there wasn't much of an external network that DEC could leverage even if they wanted to. DEC's isolated position also meant that they did not have similar access to information about new technologies like HP did, resulting in them not adapting to changing trends as quickly.

These trends are not characteristic of large companies in the two regions. Similar tendencies can be observed in smaller companies in both regions.

## 1.2 The Newcomers: Sun Microsystems vs. Apollo Computers

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OOWCc_qwh5Hkez2IDNuURw.png"></p>

Both Apollo Computers and Sun Microsystems were founded in the early 1980s in Route 128 and Silicon Valley respectively. By most accounts, the Apollo workstation was initially superior to that of Sun. But, by 1989 Apollo Computers had fallen to 4th place in the industry and was eventually acquired by HP, while Sun led the industry with over $3 billion in sales. The story of these companies is similar to their larger counterparts DEC and HP.

Apollo Computers' institutions favored proprietary hardware and software, while Sun Microsystems was pioneering open systems. Apollo's organizational structure was like DEC in its centralization. Apollo hired Thomas Vandeslice a long time East Coast executive as its CEO. Vanderslice brought a traditional, risk-averse management style focused on establishing rigid decision-making procedures, cost cutting and diversifying the firm's customer base. On the other hand, Sun developed a decentralized organizational structure focused on the flexibility to survive in a highly competitive tech market of the time. Corporate strategy was generated by discussions among representatives of autonomous divisions, instead of a centralized authority. Information communication, participation and individual initiative was encouraged.

Apollo Computers also designed and fabricated its own central processor and specialized circuits. In contrast, Sun purchased almost all its components from external vendors and subcontractors, plugging into the network of smaller organizations in the Silicon Valley region. The focus on purchasing equipment also allowed Sun to develop complex new products quickly and economically, thus staying ahead of competitors and imitators. Their products were cheaper to produce and sold for half the price of Apollo Systems'.

### *TLDR

<p style="padding: 10px; background-color: LightGoldenrodYellow;">
Apollo's proprietary and centralized institutional practices isolated position suffered from the same pitfalls as their larger counterpart, DEC. They refused to acknowlege and adopt new technologies such as RISC and UNIX and favored existing proprietary systems. Apollo's centralized organizational structure made it inflexible to industry changes. Their sluggish response was also compounded by a sparse regional network, which limited the resources and information they needed to adapt and pivot.
On the other hand Sun Microsystem's open and decentralized institutions and external network reflected that of HP. Sun Microsystems pioneered UNIX and RISC based systems, even encouraging competitors to adopt them. By leveraging Silicon Valley's industry based networks, Sun was able to cheaply produce their products with immense speed and stay ahead of competitors and imitators.

## *Main Takeaway

<b><i>The main innovation of Silicon Valley was its system of innovation (SIs).</i></b>

From these example we get a glimpse of how the Valley's organizations, institutions and networks interacted together in a way that allowed the region to adapt and stay ahead of the fast paced technological and market changes. These organizations, institutions and networks created a unique system of innovation that is flourishing to this day.
As for Route 128, its innovation system was insufficient to support adaptation to the changes in the high-tech industry. However, the region found its edge in the biopharma industry. Today, the Boston/Cambridge region leads the country's the biopharma industry supported by a different innovation system consisting of its own organizations, institutions and networks.

# 2. Motorsport Valley in the UK (2009-present)
Let's look at another story, in a different place at a different time. This story is adapted from Henry et. al's study of the Motorsport Valley [2]

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*F4hI08fVyxwmEr11BDsoRQ.png"></p>

Like a lot of people, I have been hooked to the <a href = "https://www.netflix.com/title/80204890">new Netflix documentary about Formula One</a>. The sport combines entertainment and drama with high performance engineering - the perfect mix. Out of sheer coincidence, I stumbled upon Henry et. al's article about the Motorsport Valley (MSV) and it fit right into the innovation systems (SI) framework.

Motorsport Valley (MSV) is a small cluster of firms around the Oxfordshire and Midlands region of the United Kingdoms (UK). These companies supply cutting-edge technology not only to Formula One, but also Formula E and other motorsports. The Valley dominates the design and manufacturing of components used in the majority of world's racing today. It consists of about 4,500 companies, of which 87% export their products and services. The region also spends a massive amount on R&D, with a turnover of 25%, dwarfing the R&D spending of UK's pharmaceutical industry.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MmRmfWJWb4mLg-iCSMENYQ.png"></p>

What's fascinating is that motorsport is in the center of a 'UK high-performance engineering star', where technology developed for motorsport is transferred to other sectors such as aerospace, biomedical etc. Unlike Silicon Valley, the MSV's development has largely been driven by robust public-private partnerships. For example, the Motorsport Industry Association (MIA), a private organization strategically coupled with the government's foreign and trade policy to place MSV at the center of the motorsport global production network. Already we are getting an idea of the diverse organizations involved in driving innovation in MSV. The system of organizations, institutions and networks underlying MSV become more prominent in the face of two challenges faced by the region in 2008.

## 2.1 The Challenges

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*s1nfVf3U7bB4YqZ0okmQfA.png"></p>

* <b>2008 Recession:</b> The first challenge was the global financial crisis, which throttled one of the major investment drivers of motorsport- global sponsorships.
* <b>Disruptive Technologies:</b> Around the same time, global policy and industry focus was shifting towards green, low carbon automotive technologies, as made evident with the 2008 release of Tesla's first electric car (the Roadster). At this point Motorsport was largely focused on traditional gas based technologies.

It was time for MSV to innovate out of these challenges and leverage its existing system of innovation to do so.

## 2.2 The Solution 

Two main drivers helped address these challenges:

* The UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) launched many substantially funded sector-based investment organizations targeted at R&D investment and supply chain development. The Automotive Investment Organization (AIO) was one of them. With the involvement of the Motorsport Industry Association (MIA), the AIO placed motorsport at the center of its three R&D priorities, namely: advanced propulsion, lightweighting and intelligent mobility. The organization strategized to position the UK motorsport industry's R&D capabilities as a competitive advantage for companies, within the system of global automotive and mobility R&D.

* The national government quango Technology Strategy Board launched the 2013 MSV Launchpad, which was a 'national' R&D intervention that placed motorsport and its high performance engineering at the center of developing adjacent low carbon technologies as shown below.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6H1oFtkyiQr8Bqt3qJlvBw.png"></p>

Instead of looking at low carbon technologies as disruptive, the various public-private stakeholders in motorsport positioned the industry to solve the very challenge that was disrupting it. The partnerships between various public and private organizations created the appropriate institutions that leveraged existing networks in the Valley to innovate out of the challenges faced by the industry.

## 2.3 Did it work out for them?

Yes. 

The above initiatives worked really well for MSV. Some examples of success include:

* An MSV spin-off Flybrid's Kinectic Recovery Systems technology was sold to Volvo and eventually used in vehicles like London buses, trams and JCB diggers. This is evidence of the successful low carbon techonology transfer from MSV to traditional automotives.

* Formula E all electric racing was launched in 2014, with its HQ at Donington in MSV. This would further serve as a platform to develop high performance low carbon technologies.

* A Williams Hybrid Power engine won the Le Mans 24 Hour Race for Audi, indicating that hybrid engines are on par with conventional ones. The technology was developed in MSV.

* In 2012, 43% of the surveyed MIA members were selling to other sectors such as energy, electrical and medical, further indicating the significance of MSV and its technology for other industries.

Economically, it also worked out for MSV. By 2012, the largest 10 non-F1 MSV companies had already bounced back from the 2008 financial crisis and reported their highest turnover ever. Moreover, in 2014, the UK had a continued global Formula 1 share of between 70% and 75% of supply chain value and, in addition, a 40–60% global share of supply chain value of the new Formula E based on electric power.

## *Main Takeway

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LwEg6gsa6g76ehAU3YoBLw.png"></p>

In this case, MSV was an already established innovation system that was <i>forced</i> to pivot. It made use of its organizations, networks and institutions to turn challenges into opportunities and ended up being at the forefront of UK's low carbon automotive technologies.
Public-private partnerships such as MIA and UKTI or organizations such as the Technology Strategy Board were responsible for structuring the vision for MSV in light of the challenges it was facing. These organizations then launched institutions such as the Launchpad to facilitate the development and commercialization of new technologies, spurring the region to innovate.

# 3. Conclusion

In this post I talked about two stories from three different regions spanning two different eras and industries. Both stories were different from each other.
The need for innovation in Route 128 and Silicon Valley was fueled by competition among firms, organizational dynamics and fast paced technological and industry changes. This case looked at individual organizations from both regions and compared them in to form a picture of what was working and what wasn't working for them. Key differences between Route 128 and Silicon were: proprietary vs. open systems, centralized vs. decentralized organizational structures and isolated vs. network-based production practices respectively.

For Motorsport Valley innovation was required to address external disruptive challenges to the industry, such as the 2008 financial crisis and a focus on low carbon technologies. The story looked at how government and private organizations came together with a concrete vision of how to position MSV to address these challenges. They created institutions and leveraged existing networks of MSV by having it pivot towards being an innovation hub for low carbon technologies. Unlike Silicon Valley and Route 128, in this case, stakeholders organized innovation as a response to challenges.

Regardless of the motivations and mechanisms, these stories show that innovation is not a solo endeavor by one person or entity. It is a messy complex process consisting of interactions between organizations, their networks and institutions that form unique systems of innovation that might work or not. A systemic perspective of innovation presents a starting point for us to think about what it takes for innovations to be impactful. We can start by identifying organizations, networks and institutions involved in specific innovations and analyzing their interaction to start thinking about how to innovate effectively, responsibly and sustainably.
