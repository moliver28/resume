In my previous post I talked about the various definitions of innovation and introduced the notion of a system of innovation consisting of organizations, institutions, and networks. One of the main takeaways was that innovation is not a solo endeavor (the myth of the lone inventor). It is facilitated by a system of interacting organizations steeped in various institutions and networks, which determines the outcome of the innovation process. 
In this post, I attempt to make this idea concrete through a couple of real-world stories.

# The Story of Route 128 and Silicon Valley (in the 1980s-1990s)

This story is adapted from AnnaLee Saxenian's popular comparison of the Silicon Valley and Route 128 [1].

Silicon Valley is a major hub of technological innovation. It is known to be the home of innovative technology giants such as Facebook, Apple, Google and many more. However, in the 1980s the picture was different. Silicon Valley was not the only technology hub in the country, it was competing with Route 128, located near Boston. Between 1959 and 1970, Route 128 had a higher total high-technology employment than Silicon Valley, indicating its dominance in the electronics industry. However, after 1975, the trend changed and Silicon Valley surpassed Route 128 in the total high-technology employment. Furthermore, between 1985 and 1990, the number of fastest growing electronics companies was declining in Route 128 and increasing in Silicon Valley. These trends provoke the question- what was going on? Here are two systems of innovation (SIs), one growing fast while the other declining. 
What might be driving this pattern? To answer this question, I look at what some of the organizations in both regions were doing.

## 1.1 The Giants: HP and DEC

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IUQLgqdEsxoUwAdUlLeb2A.png"></p>

Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)and HP were both major organizations in the electronics industry in the 1980s. Both were established early on in the history of electronics. DEC was established in Maynard, Massachusetts (Route 128) in 1957 and HP was founded in Palo Alto, California (Silicon Valley) in 1939. Moreover, DEC dominated Route 128 unlike any other company (including HP) dominated Silicon Valley. However, HP is still around, while DEC got acquired by Compaq at the end of the 1990s, which ironically got acquired by HP in 2002. What did HP and DEC do differently? We can analyze these difference through the lens of innovation systems and examine the <b><i>institutions and networks</i></b> driving both of these organizations.

### 1.1.1 HP & DEC: Institutions

There were notable institutional differences in how HP and DEC functioned.

* <b>Proprietary vs. Open systems:</b> DEC was adamant about building proprietary systems. They believed that the value of their products was in the "secret sauce" of their hardware and software systems. Whereas HP encouraged emerging open systems such as the UNIX operating system, which made their products compatible with other products in the market. Furthermore, HP was an early investor in the Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessor architecture, which was faster. Consequently, by1990, HP controlled 31% of the $8 billion RISC computer market, in which DEC still had no presence. DEC was still very focused on furthering the vision for its proprietary VMX operating system and VAX architecture, despite the industry shifting to UNIX and RISC based technology. In 1992, when DEC finally introduced its own RISC processor, it was too late and they ended up controlling only 13% of the market.
* <b>Organizational Structure: </b> HP was a large, decentralized firm and had an autonomous divisional structure that trained general managers while also giving them the power to make decisions fast. The benefit of this structure is described by a 16-year veteran of DEC who later switched to HP:
<blockquote>
"Running a business at the division level, you get a chance to be a general manager. You get a chance to learn . . . to be creative. . . . There are a lot of new divisions springing up [within HP], new ideas springing up, brand new businesses, and old divisions that couldn't make it anymore transform themselves into new businesses" - (From Saxenian 1996) </a>
</blockquote>

Thus, HP was fostering entrepreneurial opportunities and innovation within it. In contrast, DEC's highly centralized matrix structure disincentivized such efforts by concentrating decision making power in a few top executives. Moreover, HP's decentralized structure provided it with the agility required to survive in the highly competitive market of the time, while DEC's centralized structure prevented it from making quick decisions and moving fast.

### *TLDR

{% highlight c++  %}

HP's open and decentralized institutions allowed it to quickly capitalize on emerging trends in technology. It's readiness to acknowledge and adopt changing trends was driven by an organizational structure that supported experimentation and autonomy at lower levels of the organization. These institutional characteristics allowed HP to remain ahead of the curve and adapt to changing times.
On the other hand, DEC's proprietary and centralized institutional practices prevented it from making the quick changes it needed to remain competitive. Its reluctance to recognize and adapt to technological shifts was furthered by a centralized organizational structure. This meant that the power to govern DEC's direction was concentrated in a few number of top executives, who refused to acknowledge new technological trends and caused DEC to lose its edge by the 1990s.
