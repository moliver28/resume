Over a year ago, I asked some of my students what innovation meant to them. Over a year ago, I asked some of my students what innovation meant to them.

Unsurprisingly, I found that innovation meant different things to different people. This diversity of definitions of innovation existed not only in personal opinion, but is also reflected in definitions used across different fields in academia, industry and government [1], as you can see below.

The concept of innovation has a long history with vague and fluid definitions. However, in the 1940s, Joseph Schumpeter paved the way to rigorously study innovation from an economic perspective by popularizing the term “creative destruction”[4]. He used the notion of “creative destruction” to explain how new markets and economic structures are created through the destruction of old ones and that technological innovation was at the heart of this process. Since then, the concept of innovation has been further studied and built upon by academics in economics, management, network science etc.
In order to study innovation, academics and others have attempted to define the concept in a way that is generalizable. While there still are multiple definitions of innovation in various fields of study, some have been widely accepted. One such definition of innovation that I like to consider is used by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development [5]:

<blockquote>
“Innovation is a new or improved product or process (or combination thereof) that differs significantly from the unit’s (organization, firm, nation etc.) previous products or processes and that has been made available to potential users (product) or brought into use by the unit (process).”
</blockquote>

I like this definition as it encompasses a couple of nuanced ideas about the concept of innovation : (1) innovation is not just the creation of a new product (a thing or tangible object), it also encompasses the creation of a new process. An example of this maybe a new laboratory process to make an existing compound more efficiently or economically. (2) innovation is not just about creation; it is also about application. It is defined as a new and improved product or process and has been made available for potential use. These nuances may not be obvious to everyone, given the previous responses of my students regarding what they define as innovation. This definition of innovation also opens the door to a more systemic view of the process that is concrete yet messy and involves multiple stakeholders.

Let’s me explain what I mean through an example. When I think of an innovation, I think about the first iPhone, which I then associate with Apple and Steve Jobs, as they brought this product to market. However, when we look under hood of the iPhone, there are a myriad of technologies that Apple did not create.

These technologies were often created in research labs in universities, funded by various public agencies. If innovation was only defined as creation, then how much of an innovator was Apple or Steve Jobs? They did not create the various technologies embedded in an iPhone. However, without Apple, these technologies might have never reached customers in the way they have today. Therefore, defining innovation as process of creation and application motivates us to start thinking about it as a system of interacting entities involved in innovating novel technologies, instead of subscribing to the myth of a lone inventor in their garage.
As an engineer, I like to think in systems as it provides a simplified framework to organize and analyze complex relationships. It so turns out that in the literature of innovation studies, there is a concept of a system of innovation (SI). An SI can roughly be defined as components and relationships between those components that determine and affect the process of innovation.

According to this literature, the system of innovation has three components:

* Organizations: These are formal structures that are consciously created and have an explicit purpose. Organizations are the agents/actors in an SI. They are akin to the players of a game. Examples of some important organizations in an SI include firms, universities, venture capitalists, public agencies etc.
* Institutions: Set of common habits, norms, routines, established practices, rules or laws that govern the relations and interactions between individuals, groups, and organizations. They are akin to the rules of a game.. Examples include patent laws, along with the rules and norms influencing the relations between universities and firms
* Networks: These are the relationships between different organizations that determine how information flows between various entities in an SI.

Together, the interactions between these components can determine how effective an innovation system is. All of this sounds abstract and theoretical, so in my next post I will attempt to make this a little more concrete with a couple of examples.

## Main Takeaways
The main takeaways from this are: 

* The concept of innovation has multiple definitions depending on the context.
* Innovation is not just about creation, but also application
* Innovation involves not just the creation of a product or an object, but can also involve the creation of a new process
* Innovation is not a solo endeavor (the myth of the lone inventor). It is facilitated by a system of interacting organizations steeped in various institutions, which determines the outcome of the innovation process
