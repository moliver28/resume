date: 2021-11-23 11:12:00-0400
description: This post is a reflection on Io Blair-Freese’s talk for my department’s speaker series, where she talked about responsible and effective innovation in the context of developing countries. Io is a program officer at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, focusing on the delivery side of health interventions like vaccines in the developing world.

One of my favorite core ideas from Io's talk was her definition of responsible and effective innovation and how it incorporates equality.

Responsible innovation asks the questions: where are the people who need a specific innovation/intervention the most? Who are the various entities (governments and organizations) that serve these people?

Effective innovation touches on optimization and maximization. It asks the questions where are the people who can benefit the most? How do we maximize our resources to reach the most people and have the largest impact?

Oftentimes, responsible and effective innovation do not overlap. Individuals and societies that need a specific innovation the most often don't have the infrastructure and resources to support it, while communities where an innovation can have the maximum reach already have some technology and technological infrastructure built to support it. An example of this is the socioeconomic technological divide during the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of education. A <a href = "https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA134-3.html">study</a> found that access to internet at home increased the likelihood of completing assignments on time. Furthermore, another <a href = "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2378023120988200">study</a> found that a high speed internet connection and a higher number of internet-enabled devices was linked to higher levels of student engagement. This has resulted in the <a href = "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/kids-action/publications/homework-gap">"homework gap"</a> between students who had reliable home broadband access and those who do not. The "homework gap" is an indicator of whether a student will be able to complete their homework and succeed in school alongside their peers who have internet. According to a Pew Research Center <a href = "https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/09/01/the-internet-and-the-pandemic/">study</a>, nearly half (46%) of the parents with lower incomes whose children's schools closed reported that their children faced at least one problem related to the 'homework gap'. Therefore children, especially from lower income backgrounds who need education the most are getting left behind. In this example, online learning technologies have been an "effective" innovation in the sense that they were able to keep education going to some degree during the pandemic. However, their use may not have been responsible, as it was skewed towards specific communities and regions (rural vs. urban).

## Getting the right data

In her talk Io discussed a couple of examples regarding how the Gates Foundation and particularly her group uses Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing technologies to map health risks in developing countries. One such solution was <a href = "https://grid3.org">GRID3</a>, a multi-stakeholder effort (government, United Nations, academia and private sector) to produce maps that visualize vaccination sites, comorbidity risks and vaccination requirements (such as vaccines, number of teams, devices etc.). In such cases, it is often not sufficient to simply look at satellite data. This is because even though the data may provide a top-level view of the hospitals in a region, country borders, etc., it needs to be integrated with data "on the ground" such as surveys of staff and individuals in the relevant communities to provide a complete picture of what resources are available where and to whom, along with who has the most need for specific interventions.

Io provided an interesting insight into the challenges associated with collecting data in urban and rural settings. While urban settings may provide ample "ground level" data such as staff and supply information, the mapping aspect can be challenging due to urban density. The contrary is true to some degree in rural areas. The sparsity of rural landscapes might lend themselves well to a geospatial analysis, however validating where a structure still exists and gathering "ground level" information such as the number of staff in a hospital, supply of vaccines etc. is challenging due to lack of reporting systems in these settings. In fact, Io mentioned, some communities (and tribes) don't even show up on maps.

Therefore, we need to think carefully about how we are gathering and utilizing data in lower resource, developing world settings. Simply imitating a technology and/or methodology from high income countries does not always work. This is primarily because low resource regions may not possess the fundamental technological infrastructure such as internet and even reliable electricity to support the technology.

The <a href = "https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regional-Presence/Europe/Documents/Events/2019/Workshop%20Kyiv/Aminata%20Garba%203%20Last%20Mile%20Connectivity%20Kiev.pdf">Last Mile connectivity</a> challenge embodies the problem of lack of technological infrastructure. The "last mile" is used to refer to the final leg of telecommunication networks that deliver services to the end-user. In distant and rural areas, it is often expensive for telecommunication service providers to offer high speed and high bandwidth services when compared to the number of people being served. The economics often does not work out. Therefore, many low resource settings are constrained on connectivity and technologies that support it, such as the number of devices/computers.

An example that Io provided, that stuck with me was about asking the right questions. For example, if a survey is being conducted on a computer regarding the health of a community, it is important to keep in mind that individuals in the target region (for example, a village) may just have one or two computers available to them and thus the amount of information collected might be constrained. Therefore, the type of questions that the survey is asking may have to be changed from "who in your family…." to "who in your community…" to get as much information about the entire community as possible.

## It's not just about the technology…it's also about partnerships and people

Having the right data or even the right technological infrastructure is often not enough. It is equally important to engage the right stakeholders to drive effective and responsible innovation. For example, Io mentioned that in their work in Africa, the proximity of a community to a country' border significantly impacted the resources the community got. This is due to the prevalence of border disputes, where none of the governments involved might want to take responsibility for communities around the border, leading to lower resource availability. Moreover, most of the work around planning and allocating resources for health and other critical public services often occurs within government ministries. However, governments may turnover every four to eight years. While that is a positive indicator of democracy, the challenge is to ensure that the data and technology infrastructure established under one government is sustained long term under future governments. Therefore, it becomes important to engage the private sector in digital innovation efforts through seed funding, incubator and accelerator programs along with direct investments in partnerships with governments to build long term relationships, exchange know-how and train officials to ensure sustainable impact.

## Takeaways

The concept of effective and responsible innovation touches on the idea of equitable innovation. That is, how do we maximize the impact of a technological innovation while equalizing access and reaching people who need it most? How do we align effective with responsible innovation? Some key ideas from Io's presentation were:

* Recognizing that a technological innovation may serve different purposes in different cultural, socioeconomic or situational contexts. Therefore, simply transplanting technologies that work for high income or dominant group to a low income/low resource or minority setting might not be effective. One solution is to engage universities and research institutions in high income countries to study the applications of new technologies in low resource settings. This involves not only studying the technological details but also the behavioral, cultural and other social dimensions of these applications. Holistically addressing the introduction of a new technology from a socio-technical perspective may not only increase access but also maximize impact.

* Actively building relationships with key stakeholders. Whether its governments, academic institutions, non-profits or the private sector, buy-in from these and other relevant institutions is critical to creating sustainable technological change and advancement.

* Building up the private sector through seed funding, accelerators, direct investments etc. to ensure that a system for innovation is in place even if governments turnover.

Effective and responsible innovation is not just about creating new and advanced technologies. It is about understanding who uses these technologies, why, how and what is the socio-technical context they are embedded, while identifying who are the actors that might advocate for, support or block technological advancement from occurring in communities of interest.
