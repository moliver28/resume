A week ago, for a class, I read the work of Manuel Castells [1] and a broad overview of his work by Philip Howard [2]. For those who don't know, Manuel Castells is a prominent sociologist whose work spans across a croad category of topics from internet studies to network theory to organization studies. Castells is known to have theorized the concept of the "network society", that is a society whose networks are embedded in the use of information and communication technology.

# The Rise of the Network Society: The Network Society Actions

The crux of Castells argument is that the structure of information networks and who is included/excluded from them, configure the key social structures and activities in our society. He defines a network as a set of interconnected nodes. These nodes can be organizations, individuals, services etc., the definition of which depends on the network. Castells’ networks are open and expanding structures, as long as the nodes share the same “communication codes”. The notion of sharing the same “communication codes” alludes to the idea of an underlying protocol governing the communication between nodes, enriched by the perspectives from last week’s reading by Alex Galloway. According to Castells, “switchers” are the main power-holders in a network society. A “switcher” connects different networks together. It is reminiscent of someone who might bridge “structural holes” in a social network, as defined by Mark Granovetter (Granovetter 1973).

Castells’ argues that the network society has ushered in a distinct form of capitalism, which is global and structured around networks of financial flows. In this new form of capitalism, information networks facilitate the accumulation of capital by investment and reinvestment of profit over global financial networks. Financial capital dictates the fate of high-technology industries. However, the technology and information produced, partly by high-technology companies are essential in generating profit, which may then be reinvested over financial networks, thus accruing capital. Therefore, there exists an interdependent relationship between financial capital, high technology and industrial capital, playing out over global information networks, thus globalizing the accumulation of capital. Meanwhile, labor has become more disaggregated due to the decentralized structure of information networks. This is exemplified by the relationship between the Silicon Valley chip designer, the individual assembling the chip in a Southeast Asian production line, and the manager who might commute between the two regions. Therefore, while capital gets accumulated over the network of financial flows, labor is dissolving from the collective to the individual, thus revealing a contradiction regarding the centralizing and decentralizing tendencies of the network society.

Castells’ argues that the maintenance of capitalist relationships in light of the disaggregation of labor, results in an increasing separation of capital and labor in space and time. He refers to the asynchronous quality of technological and organizational practice in space as the space of flows. That is, practice and location are no longer interdependent, and practice now occurs globally, over electronic networks, as flow of information. Similarly, asynchrony in the sequence of capitalist practices, in the form of disaggregated labor is referred to as timeless time. Here, time does not refer to clock-time, it refers to the instantaneous time of computerized networks facilitating these practices. The new dominant forms of space and time create a meta-network that disregards “non-essential” functions, social groups and devalued territories. Value, cultural codes and power is generated within this meta-network, whose unseen and uncontrollable logic makes invisible the individual, distinct locales and activities. Cultural expressions are abstracted from history and geography (space and time?) and become principally mediated by electronic networks, that interact with the audience and ultimately get absorbed into the digitized hypertext.
Politics gets increasingly played out in the space of media networks. The meta-network increasingly appears to most people as a meta-social disorder. Therefore, Castells’ main hypothesis is that “dominant functions are organized in networks pertaining to a space of flows that links them up around the world, while fragmenting subordinate functions, and people, in the multiple space of places, made of locales increasingly segregated and disconnected from each other”.

# Castells and the Media: Theory and Media 

In Castells and the Media, Philip Howard provides an overview of Manuel Castells broad body of work while also offering critiques of Castells work. Howard highlights that the “network perspective” as developed by Castells has three fundamental assumptions: (1) the network perspective goes beyond analyzing large groups and organizations as a unit of analysis. It examines the relationship between organizations that build and manage media, the individual content
producers and the content itself. (2) the network of units of analysis reveals more than the units themselves. (3) structures of a network provide both the capacities and constraints of social action. The network perspective can be used to understand media by studying the linages and relationships between tools, contents, producers and consumers. In Castells’ view, the digital network is not randomly distributed, but has a clear core (lying mainly in the US and Western Europe) and periphery of digital function and interaction. However, from the way it is described, the core of the internet consists of many decentralized (sub)networks, which highlights the recurring contradiction of centralization and decentralization in Castells network society.

Castells undermines the state-centric understanding of where power lies. He argues that media networks are now the dominant social organizations that concentrate power and manage resources. Castells describes two types of “network power”: (1) switching power, which is the ability to project power over existing networks by directing ideas, resources and people to a subnetwork. (2) programming power, which is the ability to construct new networks by selecting ideas, resources and people and designing linkages between them. According to the network perspective, power relationships are largely defined by and through structures of communication. The centrality of a node within a network determines how much power a node wields in a network.

An overarching theme in Castells’ work has been that of decentralization in many aspects of dominant social functions. In the economic sense, this is demonstrated in examples of how firms are moving from a hierarchical (Fordist) organization to more horizontal and decentralized way of firm organization. The breaking of hierarchies has also permeated into the public and political spheres, where political campaigns are now being run in a much more decentralized manner, as exemplified by Obama’s 2008 election campaign. A similar pattern is observed in the cultural sphere of society, where instead of major studios consolidating production and distribution of content, which was delivered at a specific time (primetime TV, movie show timings etc.) and specific spaces (theaters, living rooms etc.), content is produced and distributed across a network, and does not rely on the space of places or time to be delivered. However, this is also coupled with a centralization of power that is associated with “media elites” who own much of the information infrastructure.

Howard draws conclusions from Castells regarding the personal use of digital networks. He advises individuals to : (1) exercise caution about leaving a “data-shadow” which can be used by various power-holders, (2) be aware of how the network perspective can be used and misused by political elites (3) rely on diverse networks for information and being critical of the sources and (4) be aware of one’s own position regarding digital networks. While Castells’ work has beenhighly influential, it has also garnered the following criticism (1) while Castells has developed an analytical framework of the network perspective, a lot more evidence needs to be collected to support it (2) Castells does not offer clear causal connections in his theory of how the networksociety originated and how it might have resulted in the transformations he claimed it brought about. (3) Castells does not support much of his analysis with formal models of social network analysis and (4) Castells has mostly analyzed core cultures (US and Western Europe) and does not dig deep into the periphery of media network, which might be sources of social inequality.
