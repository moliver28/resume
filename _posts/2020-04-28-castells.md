A little over a year ago, in one of my classes, I was introduced to the work of Manuel Castells and was intrigued by his take on media networks and society. Manuel Castells is a prominent sociologist whose work spans a broad category of topics from internet studies to network theory to organization studies. Castells is known to have theorized the concept of the "network society", that is a society whose networks are embedded in the use of information and communication technology. His body of work has had deep impact on media research as he has brought to light the notion that digital technologies are not just infrastructure, but also form the social structure of our modern-day society. To me, his work provided a profound perspective on how information and media networks influence the shape of and interactions in society. As I reflect on the nature of our social interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is evident that information networks play a significant role in mediating social interactions in all aspects of life and work. In the rest of the article, I will describe my (limited) understanding of Castells’ work and attempt to use it to make some sense of our lives in this pandemic.

## What is Castells’ Network?

Castells defines a network as a set of interconnected nodes. These nodes can be organizations, individuals, services etc., the definition of which depends on the network. Castells’ networks are open and expanding structures as long as the nodes share the same “communication codes”, such as values or performance goals. For example, individual mobile devices, people operating those devices, social media companies, content producer, server centers etc. all form the global network of information. The various technical protocols (such as TCP, HTTP, WiFi etc.) and mechanisms of social interaction form the “communication codes” of the global network of information. The crux of Castells argument is that the structure of information networks and who is included/excluded from them, organize the key structures and activities in our society.

## Who has power?

According to Castells, digital networks mediated by computer systems and advanced telecommunications is where power now lies. He undermines the state-centric understanding of where power lies; knowledge, not military is might. Castells argues that media networks are now the dominant social organizations that concentrate power and manage resources. Castells describes two types of “network power”: switching power and programming power. Switching power is the ability to project power over existing networks by directing ideas, resources, and people to a subnetwork. “Switchers” are one of the main powerholders in a network society due to their ability to connect different networks together. They are intermediaries who broker information across different networks, negotiate and gatekeep information that flows between different networks, which grants them immense power. For example, this might be someone who works across multiple fields of study and can interpret information across those fields. That is, they speak the language of those disciples and can translate between them. Programming power is the ability to “program” new networks by selecting ideas, resources and people and designing linkages between them. Politicians often hold programming power. They “program” policies, laws, and systems that align with their own interests and values. They also form strategic alliances between dominant players in different networks, thus designing linkages.

## Assumptions of the Network Perspective

In Castells and the Media, Philip Howard provides an overview of Castells’ broad body of work. Howard highlights that the “network perspective” as developed by Castells has three fundamental assumptions. The first assumption is that the network perspective goes beyond analyzing large groups and organizations as a unit of analysis and examines the individual content producers, and the content itself. While large organizations exercise substantial influence on media, there are plenty of instances where individuals themselves have significant political and cultural impact simply by using a social media platform on their phones. Think, Instagram influencers or twitter users with a large following. Similarly, digital media artifacts such as websites also provide meaningful insight into the structure of social interaction. Case in point- <a href = "https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/memes-4chan-trump-supporters-trolls-internet-214856/">the role of 4chan and memes</a> in the 2016 presidential race in the United States. The second assumption of the network perspective is that more often than not, the links between the units of analysis reveal more than the individual units themselves. Simply studying actors of a network in isolation might not be as insightful as understanding the relationship between those players. The final assumption is that the structure of a network can both enable and constrain social action. While a network may serve as a bridge across individuals, organizations, and content, it may also tie together similar individuals, organizations, and content, resulting in an echo chamber or “bubble communities”. A popular example is <a href = "https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2019/09/19/youtubes-algorithm-creates-echo-chambers/">YouTube’s recommendation algorithm creating political echo chambers</a>. The algorithm optimizes for viewers to keep watching. In doing so it recommends similar videos to those that viewers already like to watch, pushing them further towards a specific preference, opinion, or stance. In this way, Castells’ networks emphasize the relationships and linkages between the nodes of a network as a way of understanding how a network may enable, limit or complicate social interactions and their outcomes.

## Space of Flows and Timeless Time

My favourite concepts from Castells’ theory are his proposed notions space and time:  space of flows and timeless time

### Space of Flows

Traditionally, a space is a physical location that people live in. It invokes a sense of physical contiguity. However, information networks have the capability to organize activities and connect people in disparate parts of the world. People can participate in the same activities, at the same time without being physically near each other. They are connected by the space of information flows. Castells’ describes the space of flows as  "The material arrangements that allow for simultaneity of social practices without territorial contiguity". He said "the space of flows ... links up distant locales around shared functions and meanings on the basis of electronic circuits and fast transportation corridors, while isolating and subduing the logic of experience embodied in the space of places"

### Timeless Time
  
Time is a notion we use to organize a sequence of activities in our lives often in a physical space. However, as the notion of traditional space breaks down, so does the notion of time as we understand it. Timeless time refers to how information and communication technologies distort the notion of time by (1) compressing time into the almost instantaneous speed of electronic networks or (2) blurring the sequence of the past, present and future. For example, hyperlinks on webpages remove any notion of a sequence of events in time (or space), by taking a user from one location on the web to another in an instant.

## Space, time and capitalism

The space of flows and timeless time have collectively ushered in a distinct form of capitalism structured around networks of financial flows. Previously, finance would be physically restricted to banks or other financial agencies governed by trading hours or bank hours. However, in this new form of capitalism, information networks facilitate the accumulation of capital by investment and reinvestment of profit over global financial networks that exist everywhere and nowhere. Financial capital dictates the fate of high-technology industries. However, the technology and information produced, partly by high-technology companies are essential in generating profit, which may then be reinvested over financial networks, thus accruing capital. Therefore, there exists an interdependent relationship between financial capital, high technology, and industrial capital, playing out over global information networks and globalizing the accumulation of capital. 

Meanwhile, labor has become more disaggregated due to the decentralized structure of information networks. This is exemplified by the relationship between the Silicon Valley chip designer, the individual assembling the chip in a Southeast Asian production line, and the manager who might commute between the two regions. Therefore, while capital gets accumulated over the network of financial flows, labor is dissolving from the collective to the individual. The maintenance of capitalist relationships in light of the disaggregation of labor, results in an increasing separation of capital and labor in space and time. In this space of flows, the practice of labor and location are no longer interdependent, and practice now occurs globally, over electronic networks, as flows of information. 

An overarching theme in Castells’ work has been that of decentralization in many aspects of dominant social functions. In the economic sense, this is demonstrated in examples of how firms are moving from a hierarchical (Fordist) organization to more horizontal and decentralized way of firm organization. The breaking of hierarchies has also permeated into the public and political spheres, where <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873315000659">political campaigns</a> are now being run in a much more decentralized manner. A similar pattern is observed in the cultural sphere of society, where instead of major studios consolidating production and distribution of content, which was delivered at a specific time (primetime TV, movie show timings etc.) and specific spaces (theaters, living rooms etc.), content is produced and distributed across networks mediated by platforms such as Instagram, Tik Tok etc. It does not rely on places or time to be delivered. However, this is also coupled with a centralization of power that is associated with <a href = "https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization">media elites who own much of the information infrastructure.</a>

## The Network Society and the COVID-19 Pandemic

If anything, the COVID-19 pandemic has further enmeshed us into the network society. As physical spaces became off-limits, our social interactions increasingly occurred via information and communication networks. Our physical realities further started becoming entwined with our digital spaces. As school, work and other aspects of life that were strongly grounded in a physical space become uprooted and transitioned into a space of flows, our sense of time is also distorted. Before the pandemic, the passing of time was marked by a transition of physical space. Going to school, going to work, coming back from work, taking an evening yoga class all required us to keep track of time. In fact a <a href = "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-sense-of-time-requires-a-sense-of-space/">study</a> has found that our sense of time depends on our sense of space and that if our understanding of space is off, our understanding of time is also dislocated. However, during COVID-19, days are blending as we hop from one Zoom call to another. There exist only two spaces, the space of our homes and the space of Zoom. People are working remotely from home, attending meetings at the same time from different locations and time zones, further disaggregating labor. Students are also attending classes simultaneously, while being in different states and countries. Just like the disaggregation of labor, education and learning is also disaggregated. Conflicting emotions of physical isolation and “Zoom fatigue” allude to a sense of confusion that we face with respect to our physical selves and its disembodied digital counterpart.
