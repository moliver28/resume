description: This post is a reflection on Elizabeth Scallon’s talk for my department’s speaker series, where she talked about innovation as a key leadership function. Elizabeth leads the Go To Market & Operations at Amazon’s Alexa Fund and has been involved in the innovation ecosystem for over a decade.

In her talk, Elizabeth emphasized the role of leadership within an organization as being integral to the process of innovation, as leadership is responsible for setting the stage for innovation along the following four aspects:

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/489/1*gqfMWbg0o_xVL9OLj9jHHQ.png"></p>

Innovation does not take place in isolation and simply thinking about good ideas do not make them happen. It requires an intentional approach on the part of an organization and its leaders to plan and organize processes that foster innovation and growth within the organization. This is not just relevant to corporations but can be applicable to any organization such as universities, government, and non-profits. In fact, being steeped in the university culture for so long, I have observed how changing the leadership can impact everything, from funding for student clubs to curriculum to the name of a department. These university leaders were able to set a vision, strategize and gather resources to make, what they thought were innovative changes at the institution.

To foster and catalyze innovation in an organization, Elizabeth proposed key questions along 4 dimensions, that leadership should contend with:

# I. Problems

To ensure the survival of their organization, leaders need to constantly keep an eye out for problems that need to be solved and provide relevant growth opportunities, whether in their market or adjacent markets. The best way to identify problems is asking questions and engaging with people, be it employees or customers. Elizabeth offered three methods to do that: “5 Whys”, the Scientific method and the Socratic method. The goal of these methods is to understand the root cause of an issue and dive deep into the fundamentals of what might seem to be a superficial problem. She suggested doing this by not just talking to people but testing hypotheses and collecting data to demonstrate the significance of the problem being considered and crafting a vision and story around it.

In line with the Schumpeterian idea of “creative destruction”, a disruptive innovation disturbs the existing market by fundamentally changing its structure and making obsolete what was the dominant technology in that market. For example, Uber disrupted the taxicab industry by essentially creating a new technology (and labor) market, which rendered obsolete the traditional way of getting a taxi. It was a culmination of various technologies coming together (GPS, mobile apps, mobile payments etc.) to fundamentally solve a problem and challenge the status quo. Therefore, it falls upon leadership to deeply think about existing problems and start congregating the right ideas, people, and resources to solve them.

# II. People

People are a vital aspect of the innovation process. Simply having a compelling problem to solve is not sufficient, there needs to be the right team with the right set of skills to tackle the innovation challenge. The key question that leadership needs to ask here is: who are the people engaged in the innovation process at an organization? There are two aspects to this question.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/491/1*hFSaqceAGpZ4EDzJcWOF3g.png"></p>


How an organization structures its innovation processes determines who is involved in it. For example, whether an organization has an innovation lab or a single executive working on innovation provides a picture of who are the decision-makers and influencers in the innovation process. The behavioral aspect is more fundamental as it asks who is empowered to innovate? Does everyone feel like they can bring an idea to the table? Do they feel heard? This is the key area where diversity, equity and inclusion efforts play a vital role in the success of an organization. As Elizabeth mentioned in her talk, people tend to believe in a meritocratic system, where good ideas will eventually bubble up, without much effort. However, who gets a seat at the table is determine by a pre-existing set of biases, which are inevitable. Therefore, it is up to the leadership to determine how they can empower lesser heard voices to speak or include more voices to be part of the conversation. Including a diverse group of people also allows for scoping the problem in a manner that addresses a variety of perspectives and can increase the reach of the potential innovation (product or process) to a larger customer base.

# III. Solutions

Once there is a problem to solve and a diverse team to solve it, the next step is to source a variety of solutions. Again, according to the talk, it is the role of leadership to determine the process of idea generation and evaluation. Does an organization like to source ideas internally or work with external partners and entities to do so? How does an organization determine whether an idea is good? Are there measures and evaluation criteria in place to do so? Having a systematic process to source and evaluate ideas allows for a data-driven and informed way to make decisions around which ideas are worth pursuing and which aren’t. The leadership of a company determines the processes and mechanism that implement how ideas are brought to the table, who brings them to the table and who gets to evaluate potential solutions.

A concrete example of this was examined in the previous post. It discussed how DEC and Apollo Computers leadership in Route 128 chose to be secretive and internal about their innovation process, while Silicon Valley companies like HP and Sun Microsystems leveraged the burgeoning and open Silicon Valley networks to be agile and innovate quickly. This is not to make a value judgement and say that one approach is better than the other but point out that how leadership decides to source and evaluate innovation is critical and makes a difference in the success of an organization.

# IV. Resources

No idea can be brought to fruition without money and resources. The leadership of a company determines how resources are allocated to the innovation process. Firstly, is there a budget for innovation, such as R&D investments etc.? What happens to the budget when funding is tight? The answers to these questions often indicate how serious leadership is about innovation and their priorities around it. Another aspect of resource allocation is determining whether there is a systematic process behind it. For example, are there phases to funding an innovation, such as starting from a pilot and scaling up? Or is it more informal? Therefore, the resource allocation strategy of the organization’s leadership controls how an innovation is brought to market and whether it is profitable or not.


# Takeaways

These four functions of leadership in its role in an organization’s innovation process can be distilled into the following takeaways:

<p style="padding: 10px; background-color: LemonChiffon">

* Leadership requires creating a safe space for experimenting with, identifying, and communicating relevant and fundamental problems that need to be innovated upon.

* Leadership involves creating an open environment for ensuring that everyone is empowered to innovate through engaging a diverse group of employees and stakeholders to participate in the innovation process.

* Leadership is about challenging the status quo thinking and pursing potentially unconventional ideas.

* Leadership for innovation requires ensuring that the business survives by creating mechanisms and processes to fund and grow innovation.

# Connecting the Dots

In my <a href = "https://medium.com/@shrutimisra/understanding-innovation-part-i-a-what-is-innovation-c3e5f446472b">previous posts</a> I talked about innovation systems (SIs), which comprise of organizations, institutions and networks and interactions between them determine the dynamics of the system and affect the innovation process. Elizebeth’s talk about innovation as a function leadership presents a view of how can people within organizations create effective institutions for innovation. Unlike my <a href = "https://medium.com/@shrutimisra/understanding-innovation-part-i-b-systems-of-innovation-f3a1c30bdf5c">previous examples</a>  of Silicon Valley, Route 128 and Motorsport Valley that offer a zoomed out, ecosystem level perspective about SIs, this talk really honed in on what can leaders and individuals do to foster innovation in their organization. The talk emphasized that decisions by leaders are what create the institutions and environment for innovation, which impact the entire innovation system and can lead to effective innovation.
