As part of my research regarding understanding innovation practices in an industry sponsored engineering capstone program, I conducted interviews with students who had enrolled in the program in the last year (2019–2020). As someone who comes from a quantitative engineering background, qualitative research methods have been difficult for me to grasp. I recognize the value of such methods as being vital to tease out the stories that underlie experiences of individuals. However, for someone who has been so thoroughly steeped in a post-positivist approach to research and inquiry, the process of constructionist, postmodern or critical qualitative inquiry is an mix of mystery, excitement, anxiety and fulfillment.

Once I had my research question hashed out, I developed my first semi-structured interview protocol with help from my advisor. The protocol was initially developed for IRB (board for the protection of human subjects in research) purposes and therefore I assumed that the questions I put in it for absolute and final. I was feeling fairly confident going into the interviews-I had my set of questions and prided myself as being somewhat of an easy conversationalist. Moreover, I also assumed that my avid podcast listening might have magically and “unconsciously” schooled me in the art of interviewing. What was there to worry about- it’s just a conversation with some students about their experience, right?

Well yes and no. The interviews began and I realized that my podcast listening did not really come in handy. For my first couple of interviews, I was adamant on following the order prescribed in my protocol. All of my engineering education had trained me to go step-by-step and follow the order of instructions, just like executing lines of code. I felt like I can’t simply jump around. Moreover, I was also adamant on covering all the questions on my protocol- what if I missed something important? Not realizing that doing that can not only interrupt the flow of the conversation, but take away the depth of a response that I might’ve cut short to stick to time. I thought I was doing pretty great-sticking to the protocol. My advisor, who was kind enough to sit-in on these interviews, basically told me that I need to do things differently. The way I assumed the protocol to be structured was taking away depth of potential information. Instead of probing further and being comfortable with taking the conversation in an unplanned (un-protocoled) direction, I was just moving on to the next question. It was then that the implication of “qualitative research is messy” (words of one of my professors) dawned upon me.
There is no way for me to precisely plan for the direction that someone else’s story is going to take. It is this process of shaping someone else’s story by filtering it through my questions that has been so astonishing. The questions are like the numbers in the connect-the-dots picture. The protocol gives us an idea of how many dots there might be to connect, but not necessarily their order. The order roughly depends on the interviewee and the flow of conversation. If placed and asked appropriately, the questions reveal a full coherent picture. Two interviewees may not offer the same picture and therefore the placement and form of the questions may differ greatly between the two. Recognizing and responding to these differences is what I think a practiced interviewer is good at.


To me, the goal of qualitative interviews is crafting a story based on multiple peoples’ experiences. It’s about threading together bits and pieces of information that is scattered across multiple (subjective) experiences, steeped in personal assumptions and may suffer from recall bias. Unlike the highly objective process of quantitative analysis, qualitative analysis is about context, uncertainty and being comfortable with subjetivity. Being steeped in STEM for as long as I have, the fluid and subjective characteristics of qualitative research have been challenging to square with. But at the end of the day, I learned that all I need to remember is that with interviews, I’m trying to tell other peoples’ story. Those stories may have unexpected turns that may not fit my hypothesis but offer value nonetheless. Accepting the subjective and going with it has been my key learning from this process. It has not just made me a better qualitative researcher but has opened up another lens to look at the world with and marvel at the myriad of stories it has to offer and learn from.
