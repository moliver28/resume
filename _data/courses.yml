- year: 2017
  items:  
    - name: Engineering Entrepreneurial Systems and Design
      id: ee496_2017
      abbr: EE 496
      inst: University of Washington
      description: This course covered fundamentals of systems engineering, feasibility studies, project management and design, budgeting, risk and liability, and intellectual property and patents. This course lays a foundation for the entrepreneurial capstone projects taking place in the subsequent two quarters (EE-497/498).
    
    - name: Introduction to Embedded System
      id: ee474_2017
      abbr: EE 474
      inst: University of Washington
      hardware: Beaglebone Black microcontoller
      software: C
      description: An introductory course in the specification, design, development, and test of real time embedded system software. Topics include abstract data types; polling; interrupts; data exchange; I/O schemes; operating system concepts including processes and process state, scheduling and schedulers, single and multiple tasks; system performance and optimization; reliability, and testing. Using the BeagleBone Black microcomputer as a target environment a series of laboratory projects study various aspects of embedded system design and a comprehensive final project brings together all of the concepts taught in the course.
    
    - name: Introduction to C and Microprocessors
      id: ee299_2017
      abbr: EE 299
      inst: University of Washington
      hardware: Arduino
      software: C
      description: This was a hands-on class that introduced the C language and microprocessors. Through in-class exercises, homeworks, and a series of practical lab projects, students developed and practiced good software design methodologies using the C language then apply these skills towards developing, debugging, and testing embedded applications for an Arduino microprocessor.

    - name: Computer Architecture I
      id: ee469_2017
      abbr: EE 469
      inst: University of Washington
      hardware: Altera DE1-SOC dev board with Cyclone V FPGA
      software: C, Verilog HDL
      description: Introduction to computer architecture, algorithms and CPU control unit design, memory organization, cache design and virtual memory. Through a series of lab projects, students developed an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and various dataflow, control flow and memory sytems that enable proper data processing by the ALU.
- year: 2016
  items:
    - name: Design of Digital Circuits and Systems
      id: ee371_2016
      abbr: EE 371
      inst: University of Washington
      hardware: Altera DE1-SOC dev board with Cyclone V FPGA
      software: C, Verilog HDL
      description: An intermediate level course in the design and development of digital /embedded systems.  The main objective of the class is to provide students with a theoretical background to and practical experience with the tools, techniques, and methods for solving challenges related to modeling complex systems using the Verilog hardware description language (HDL), signal integrity, managing power consumption in digital systems, and ensuring robust intra and inter system communication working with systems of midlevel complexity.
