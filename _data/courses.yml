  items:
    - name: Design of Digital Circuits and Systems
      id: ee371_2016
      abbr: EE 371
      inst: University of Washington
      hardware: Altera DE1-SOC dev board with Cyclone V FPGA
      software: C programming language, Verilog HDL
      description: An intermediate level course in the design and development of digital /embedded systems.  The main objective of the class is to provide students with a theoretical background to and practical experience with the tools, techniques, and methods for solving challenges related to modeling complex systems using the Verilog hardware description language (HDL), signal integrity, managing power consumption in digital systems, and ensuring robust intra and inter system communication working with systems of midlevel complexity.
- year: 2017
  items:
    - name: Introduction to Embedded System
      id: ee474_2017
      abbr: EE 474
      inst: University of Washington
      hardware: Beaglebone Black microcontoller
      software: C programming language
      description: An introductory course in the specification, design, development, and test of real time embedded system software. Topics include abstract data types; polling; interrupts; data exchange; I/O schemes; operating system concepts including processes and process state, scheduling and schedulers, single and multiple tasks; process synchronization including critical sections, semaphores, and deadlocks; system performance and optimization; reliability, fault tolerance, and test. Using the TI Sitara, AM3358BZCZ100 BeagleBone Black microcomputer as a target environment a series of laboratory projects study various aspects of embedded system design and a comprehensive final project brings together all of the concepts taught in the course.
