The COVID-19 pandemic led to preventative measures such as social distancing, resulting in many higher education institutions closing their campuses and transitioning to remote learning. While remote instruction can be beneficial, the sudden shift to online learning during the pandemic was not comparable to traditional online teaching models, which require prior planning and preparation. Consequently, the educational experience for students may have been compromised, despite instructors' intensive preparations. However, not much attention has been given to how students adapted and demonstrated resilience during the pandemic. **This study focused on the industry-sponsored design capstone at a large public research institution to understand how students perceived, adapted to, and mitigated the impact of the pandemic.**

# Key Questions
<br>
- What are the relevant factors necessary to explore student learning outcomes?
- How were (industry and teammate) support linked to student learning outcomes?
- How and why were student learning outcomes impacted by instructional support?

# Participants
The study involved a cohort of students who enrolled in the industry sponsored engineering design capstone (ENGINE) during the 2021-2022 academic year. The capstone is a two (ten week) quarter program spanning winter and spring quarters for a total of 20 weeks. In 2021-2022, the program hosted 184 students, 177 of which were electrical and computer engineering majors. Students had an opportunity to select from about 48 projects. Approximately 80% of the projects were sponsored by industry, while the remaining were sponsored by government organizations.
