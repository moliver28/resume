The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between the support students receive from their peers (teammates) and industry mentors during an industry sponsored engineering design capstone and their perceptions about technical and non-technical learning outcomes. Capstone design courses are an important requirement for undergraduate engineering programs, and industry sponsored capstone programs are one way to provide students with the opportunity to work on real-world problems. However, these programs vary widely in implementation, and there is a gap in understanding the influence of peer and industry mentor support on student learning outcomes in the capstone experience.

# Key Questions
<br>
- What are the relevant factors necessary to explore student learning outcomes?
- How were (industry and teammate) support linked to student learning outcomes?
- How and why were student learning outcomes impacted by instructional support?

# Participants
The study involved a cohort of students who enrolled in the industry sponsored engineering design capstone (ENGINE) during the 2021-2022 academic year. The capstone is a two (ten week) quarter program spanning winter and spring quarters for a total of 20 weeks. In 2021-2022, the program hosted 184 students, 177 of which were electrical and computer engineering majors. Students had an opportunity to select from about 48 projects. Approximately 80% of the projects were sponsored by industry, while the remaining were sponsored by government organizations.

# Methodology

I designed a self-reflection survey to collect large-scale quantitative data on students' perceptions of support and learning. The self-reflection survey contained 36 closed-ended (Likert type questions) and 5 open-ended questions. The close-ended questions were adapted from different scales developed to assess engineering design performance, entrepreneurial and students' innovation competencies and faculty support along with items that I newly developed for this study.
