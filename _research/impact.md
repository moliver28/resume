<a href = "https://nursing.uw.edu/person/jennifer-sonney/">Dr. Jen Sonney</a> at the University of Washington's School of Nursing had developed a prototype for a new asthma management app (IMPACT) in collaboration with children with asthma and their parents. She wanted to take the app to market but needed some help. As a sole researcher for this project I conducted: 
- user and stakeholder interviews
- competitive analysis
- customer segmentation

## Result
I delivered a concrete 6 year product design and funding strategy based on extensive user and stakeholder research and product and industry analysis. Based on my research, I also suggested key MVP (minimum viable product) requirements and constraints that can guide further development of the prototype.

# Key Research Objectives and Approaches

- **In healthcare, who buys and who pays for this type of technology varies and are often not the user** -> Spend extra time getting to know the ecosystem and whoâ€™s involved
- **FDA approval is expensive and time consuming** -> Investigate if FDA approval is needed and if so what the specific impact will be on commercialization

These objectives gave rise to the following key questions and approach:

## 1. User Interview Review
### Purpose
The goal was to understand the motivation behind the creation of the IMPACT app and who needed it. Dr. Sonney's team had already gathered data from interviews and usability studies, but the task was to recontextualize the findings in a business context using the lean business canvas.
### Method
I reviewed and coded interview data from 10 interviews with parents and children into categories outlining pain points, existing asthma management behavior and existing tools that users use. Further, I reviewed and coded data from the usability studies into categorizes that highlight the advantages of, improvements to and usage of the IMPACT app.
### Outcome
Through this qualitative exercise, it was evident that there was a real customer problem, and the outcome helped in developing the prototype's initial unique value proposition.
