The COVID-19 pandemic, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, led to the implementation of preventative measures such as social distancing, resulting in many higher education institutions closing their campuses and transitioning to remote learning. While remote instruction can be beneficial, the sudden shift to online learning during the pandemic was not comparable to traditional online teaching models, which require prior planning and preparation. The lack of time and support characterized remote learning during the pandemic as emergency remote teaching (ERT). Consequently, the educational experience for students may have been compromised, despite instructors' intensive preparations. However, not much attention has been given to how students adapted and demonstrated resilience during the pandemic. This study focused on the industry-sponsored design capstone at a large public research institution to understand how students perceived, adapted to, and mitigated the impact of the pandemic.

# Key Questions
<br>
- What are the factors that contributed to student perceptions of learning in the ENGINE capstone program during COVID-19?
- Was there a difference in student perceptions of learning during the COVID and non-COVID iteration of the capstone?
- How did the student capstone design experience change during the COVID-19 pandemic?

# Participants
The study involved two cohorts of students who participated in the design (ENGINE) capstone in 2018 and 2020. The ENGINE capstone is a 20-week program consisting of two quarters, with about 115 students, most of whom are electrical and computer engineering majors. The program offers about 35 projects, with 90% of them being sponsored by industry. During the program, students develop and scope a project proposal with their industry mentors in the first quarter, and in the second quarter, they work on project realization until the end of the program. Students participate in biweekly meetings with teaching assistants and present their projects at the end of the quarters. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Spring quarter of the capstone design experience shifted to remote learning, and all meetings with TAs and mentors, project presentations, and poster fair were conducted virtually.

# Methodology
<br>
To conduct the study, the researchers used multiple sources of data. They collected ordinal data from student surveys using a Likert scale to understand how various aspects of the course contributed to student learning. In addition to surveys, the researchers also used qualitative data from two major documents submitted by student design teams during Spring 2020: a COVID mitigation plan submitted at the beginning of the quarter, and a final project report that described how the pandemic had affected their project.


## 1. Surveys
### Purpose
To understand how learning was impacted during COVID-19, the first step was to define what students perceived that they learned during the capstone. To do so, I collaborated with he College of Engineering's Engineering Teaching and Learning department to design a survey that would be administered to students during the capstone. The goal of the survey was to collect large-scale quantitative data to obtain factors that impacted student's perceptions of learning.

### Method
The survey was conducted online, mid-way through the Spring 2018 and Spring 2020 quarters. It enabled students to self-report which aspects of the program aided or inhibited student learning. A total of 96 students were surveyed in 2018, with a response rate of 26%, while 115 students were surveyed in 2020, with a response rate of 69%. Participation was voluntary, and no identifying information was collected. All results are cross-sectional. Factors measuring students' perceptions of learning emerged from an Exploratory Factor Analysis in R. These factors were compared for survey responses pre and post COVID-19 using independent sample t-tests.

### Outcome
Thirteen survey items were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis. The analysis revealed four factors: "Real-world Experience", "Assessment", "Instructional Support", and "Task Value" that impacted students' perceptions of learning. These factors accounted for 76% of the total variance and showed adequate reliability (Cronbach's alpha > 0.7). 

The "Real-world Experience" factor included items associated with experiential learning. The "Assessment" factor consisted of items associated with student assignments such as presentations and evaluation. The "Instructional Support" factor contained three items related to faculty, instructor, and TA guidance. The "Task Value" factor consisted of two items measuring students' expectations and appreciation for the capstone.

Surprising, independent sample t-tests did not find any significant differences differences between traditional and remote learning. This gave rise to the hypothesis that lack of significant difference maybe because students adapted rapidly to the remote learning disruption. To explore this hypothesis, we analyzed qualitative data from student assignments and open-ended questions in the survey.
