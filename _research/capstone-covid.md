The COVID-19 pandemic led to preventative measures such as social distancing, resulting in many higher education institutions closing their campuses and transitioning to remote learning. While remote instruction can be beneficial, the sudden shift to online learning during the pandemic was not comparable to traditional online teaching models, which require prior planning and preparation. Consequently, the educational experience for students may have been compromised, despite instructors' intensive preparations. However, not much attention has been given to how students adapted and demonstrated resilience during the pandemic. **This study focused on the industry-sponsored design capstone at a large public research institution to understand how students perceived, adapted to, and mitigated the impact of the pandemic.**

# Key Questions
<br>
- What are the factors that contributed to student perceptions of learning in the ENGINE capstone program during COVID-19?
- Was there a difference in student perceptions of learning during the COVID and non-COVID iteration of the capstone?
- How did the student capstone design experience change during the COVID-19 pandemic? 
<hr>
# Participants
The study involved two cohorts of students who participated in the design (ENGINE) capstone in 2018 and 2020. The ENGINE capstone is a 20-week program consisting of two quarters, with about 115 students, most of whom are electrical and computer engineering majors. The program offers about 35 projects, with 90% of them being sponsored by industry. During the program, students develop and scope a project proposal with their industry mentors in the first quarter, and in the second quarter, they work on project realization until the end of the program. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Spring quarter of the capstone design experience shifted to remote learning, and all meetings with TAs and mentors, project presentations, and poster fair were conducted virtually.

# Methodology
<br>
The study used multiple sources of data. Ordinal data was collected from student surveys using a Likert scale to understand how various aspects of the course contributed to student learning. In addition to surveys, qualitative data was used from two major documents submitted by student design teams during Spring 2020: a COVID mitigation plan submitted at the beginning of the quarter, and a final project report that described how the pandemic had affected their project.


## 1. Surveys
### Purpose
To understand how learning was impacted during COVID-19, the first step was to define what students perceived that they learned during the capstone. To do so, I collaborated with he College of Engineering's Engineering Teaching and Learning department to design a survey that would be administered to students during the capstone. The goal of the survey was to collect large-scale quantitative data to obtain factors that impacted student's perceptions of learning.

### Method
The survey was conducted online, mid-way through the Spring 2018 and Spring 2020 quarters. It enabled students to self-report which aspects of the program aided or inhibited student learning. A total of 96 students were surveyed in 2018, with a response rate of 26%, while 115 students were surveyed in 2020, with a response rate of 69%. Participation was voluntary, and no identifying information was collected. Factors measuring students' perceptions of learning emerged from an Exploratory Factor Analysis in R. These factors were compared for survey responses pre and post COVID-19 using independent sample t-tests.

### Outcome
Thirteen survey items were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis. The analysis revealed four factors: "Real-world Experience", "Assessment", "Instructional Support", and "Task Value" that impacted students' perceptions of learning. These factors accounted for 76% of the total variance and showed adequate reliability (Cronbach's alpha > 0.7). 

The "Real-world Experience" factor included items associated with experiential learning. The "Assessment" factor consisted of items associated with student assignments such as presentations and evaluation. The "Instructional Support" factor contained three items related to faculty, instructor, and TA guidance. The "Task Value" factor consisted of two items measuring students' expectations and appreciation for the capstone.

Surprising, independent sample t-tests did not find any significant differences differences between traditional and remote learning. This gave rise to the hypothesis that lack of significant difference maybe because students adapted rapidly to the remote learning disruption. To explore this hypothesis, we analyzed qualitative data from student assignments.

## 2. Qualitative Analysis
### Purpose
The quantitative results from the survey highlighted that there was no difference in students' perceptions of learning in the traditional vs. remote environment. This was surprising given the fact that in the remote setting students had to pivot to doing hands-on project work online. A qualitative approach was deemed suitable to identify common themes among the unique and varied experiences of the 35 student teams during the pandemic. To achieve this, the final project reports and COVID-19 mitigation plan assignments of each team were analyzed. The reports contained technical and non-technical aspects of the projects, while the mitigation plan assignments detailed how the teams would adapt to the remote setting and if they needed additional resources.

### Method
The two sources of qualitative data were analyzed using an inductive approach to identify emergent themes. The constant comparative approach was then employed to establish and refine boundaries to the categories and summarize their content. Finally, the categories were compared across different sources of data to identify patterns in the students' experience during the capstone program.

### Outcome
The qualitative analysis found that the ENGINE capstone experience for students was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in three basic ways: product adaptations, process adaptations, and no change. The study suggests that COVID-19 caused major disruptions to the traditional student experience of the capstone program, despite the absence of significant differences in student perceptions.

- **Product Adaptations:** Half of the capstone projects had to adapt due to the pandemic by reducing their project scope, switching from physical to software prototypes, or forgoing subsystem integration. The inability to access labs and equipment was the main reason for these adaptations, especially for hardware-leaning projects. Hindered communication and collaboration, difficulty in transporting hardware, and shipping delays were also factors. Teams adapted by recalibrating and reducing expectations, changing project deliverables, and relying on lab space and different retailers for parts.

- **Process Adaptations:** Around 28.6% of projects had to adapt their design process due to pandemic-related constraints, such as lack of access to lab resources, closure of data collection and testing sites, shipping delays, and hindered communication. Teams resorted to using limited datasets for testing, reducing expectations for project deliverables, and changing the methods of proving their system works. Some students raised concerns regarding reduced work efficiency and team coordination, as well as the difficulty of expressing ideas remotely as challenges that hindered their process. 

- **No Change:** About one-third of the projects in the capstone were not affected by the pandemic because they were purely software-based, which allowed them to work remotely and share resources easily. The only challenge these teams faced was the switch to remote interaction and time zone changes for some team members and industry mentors

### How did students adapt?

Students used a variety of strategies to overcome challenges in team roles and structure, tools and technology, technical changes, resource coordination, and communication. Students used independent roles, screen sharing, project management tools, messaging platforms, and creative technical solutions to complete their projects. They also increased meeting frequency to stay engaged and ensure everyone remained on track. Despite the pandemic disruptions, student perceptions of learning were not different across the remote and traditional setting, as students mitigated the effects of the pandemic by adapting their strategies and decisions to the uncertain environment.
